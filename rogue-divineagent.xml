            <p>Not all priests are clerics. Not all problems can be solved by prayer and preaching. Sometimes a more subtle touch is needed to steer the world as the faith dictates, and that is the roll of a Divine Agent. A blade in the night that commits the lesser evil for the greater good, or a quick end to someone that sniffed too close the Cult of Vecna's business, both could be the work of these divinely guided rogues.</p>
            <p class="indent">Good is not nice, evil is not stupid. Whatever the organization or god a Divine Agent serves, it is one that understands the practical nature of the world. Spying, stealing, extracting information, purging the heretics... they have many tasks before them, and complete them with a grim determination.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Divine Agent is almost always lawful following an organizational code with zealous focus, but the laws they follow may or may not have any relation to the laws of the land they are in.</p>
