        <description>
            <p>A dangerous branch of psionics that are born from the ability to sap energy from other creatures, tearing from them their thoughts, their mind, and ultimately their vitality for your own consumption. A feared branch of power, it is often believed to be one of the roots of psionic power as it is a branch of power found in many of the most ancient and terrible practitioners of psionics, such as Illithids and Aboleths.</p>
            <p class="indent">It has been refined by those that seek greater power either from ambition or desperation, and unlocks a terrible but effective path. One example of mortal creatures walking this path is the drow House Oblodra, who developed their dark powers from their study of feral vampiric mindflayers.</p>

            <p class="indent">When you use psionic abilities, you can make an Intelligence (Deception) check contested by a target's Wisdom (Insight) to conceal your use of psionic powers, suppressing their usual visible indicators. If you spend psi points on the ability, you must subtract the psi points spent from your Intelligence (Deception) roll result (concealing greater uses of psionics being more difficult).</p>
