            <p>A shaman is an occultist that walks the paths of the spirits, binding them to their cause to empower themselves or bring havoc to their foes. Tough and powerful, they are most often found in the thick of the fight, wreathed in their primal power.</p>
            <p class="indent">A shaman may view themselves as in service to their spirits or as served by the spirits; the what and the how of their contract can vary wildly, as can the source of their spirits, be it pulling from an ancestral or primal powers.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action you can call a spirit to your side. This can be a primal spirit of fire, cold, or lightning, or an ancestral spirit with radiant or necrotic power. This bond lasts for 10 minutes once formed. You can release a spirit early as an action, and it is immediately released if you call another spirit.</p>
            <p class="indent">While a spirit is bonded to you it strengthens your melee weapon attacks, causing them to deal an additional 1d4 damage of the spirit's type.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action while it is bonded, you can manifest the spirit within 30 feet of you. The spirit is medium sized but spectral in nature while manifested. While the spirit is manifested, whenever you take the attack action you may replace any number of attacks you could normally take with melee spell attacks from your bonded spirit. Melee spell attacks done by the spirit deal 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier damage of the same spirit's type on a hit. As a bonus action you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction or recall it to yourself, ending its manifestation.</p>
            <p class="indent">A manifested spirit cannot move more than 60 feet from you, and is recalled to you if you move more than 60 feet from it.</p>
