        <description>
            <p>A Wandering Mind is among the more mysterious incarnates of psions, these are individuals that just aren't quite rooted in the same reality everyone else is... they find it more pliable and slippery, and prone to jumping right through it on occasion.</p>
            <p class="indent">How they get their powers varies. Some were born in the ethereal plane or went through a portal too young. Sometimes it is just that their mind just works along an axis most people cannot understand. No matter its source, they manifest a truly unique ability to treat certain aspects of the metaphysical with a certain mundanity, and are prone to treating their powers as absolutely natural things as one might use an arm or a leg.</p>
            <p class="indent">They tend toward curious and chaotic, unbounded and hard to pin down, they are natural wanderings in mind and body.</p>
