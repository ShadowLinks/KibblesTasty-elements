            <p>A Fleshsmith is the sort of person that makes people uncomfortable. Even when encountered in the most ideal circumstances, they simply have the sort of gaze that makes one think they may be thinking "how could I improve that" as they look at you.</p>
            <p class="indent">A particular path of Inventor that has turned their creative talents... inward. They seek to understand and improve the limitations of flesh. All too frequently they place a slightly different value on aesthetic than others might, tending to find beauty primarily in efficiency.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Fleshsmith tends to be more eccentric than inclined to any particular alignment, though even the most benevolent one may find that the only reason their activities wouldn't be illegal is that no one considered them possible.</p>

            <p>You know that perfection is an aspect of knowledge, a perfect understanding of the mechanics of the Body, inside and out. But particularly inside. You gain the <strong>Dissection</strong> upgrade, and it does not count against your upgrade total.</p>
            <p class="indent">You have a pool of d8s equal to your Inventor level. When you restore hit points to a creature or use an Intelligence (Medicine) check to deal damage to a creature, you can expend these d8s to restore additional health or deal additional damage.
