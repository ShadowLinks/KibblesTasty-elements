            <p>A Spellweaver is a magically adapt individual who holds great mechnical knowledge of magic and its tactical applications, but frequently lacks - or at least doesn't focus on - the raw power arcane power that a Wizard or Sorcerer might. A deft touch to manipulate magic, pulling and warping the spells of others, shrouding their allies with abjuration and illusion, their touch is subtle and effective.</p>
            <p class="indent">A careless observe may take their efforts as less, but a wise one realizes the danger of their manipulations can far outweigh a flashy fireball when it comes to shifting the tides of war.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level when you take this Presence, you gain proficiency in the arcana skill, and learn two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard or Bard spell list from the abjuration, enchantment, or illusion schools. These are Warlord spells for you.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use your magic to subtly influence the battlefield, tweaking and modifying spells and attacks with your magic. You learn three of the following options, gaining an additional option at 6th and 14th level.</p>
            <h5>ARCANE SURGE</h5>
            <p>As a reaction to an ally casting a spell, you can expend one leadership die adding it to or subtracting it from one attack roll or damage roll of that spell.</p>
            <h5>ILLUSORY DISTRACTION</h5>
            <p>As a reaction to a creature being the target of an attack, you can expend one Leadership Die to cause an illusory distraction. Roll the leadership die and subtract it from the attack roll.</p>
            <h5>PULL SPELL</h5>
            <p>As a reaction to a spell targeting an ally within 30 feet or a radius that includes you, you can make the spell target you. For a radius this places the center of the radius on you.</p>
            <h5>REDIRECTION</h5>
            <p>You can redirect a ranged weapon or spell attack that has missed its target. As a reaction to a missed attack you can expend one Leadership Die to reroll the attack against another creature within 30 feet of the target, in the case of a leveled spell, redirecting the spell in this fashion requires a number of Leadership Dice equal to the spell's level.</p>
            <h5>TWEAK AREA</h5>
            <p>As reaction to an allies casting a spell with an area of effect, you can expend warp the shape of their spell. You can exclude a creature within the effect or include a creature not in the effect but adjacent to the spell from being affected by the spell, spending one leadership die for each creature excluded or included.</p>
