        <description>
            <p>A Thundersmith is an Inventor who harnesses the primal force of elemental power, channeling its power into their great creation: a weapon of unmatched devastation. Spectacular and terrible, these weapons bring fear to their foes and awe to their allies.</p>
            <p class="indent">Why an Thundersmith bends their mind to the task of making such a thing - some are coldly analytical about the destruction it causes, seeking to continually improve it, tweaking it for ever more optimized destruction, while others view it merely as a tool, a means to an end, while others still reveal in the crash of thunder that heralds the terrifying force of their weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">While some may look at these weapons as the dawn of a new age, in truth wielding them is a tricky and arcane art no simpler than making them, something only the one who forged the device will every truly master, each weapon a unique piece of devastating art.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, you harness the power of elemental power of thundering storms to create a powerful weapon. This weapon requires attunement and you are proficient with it while attuned. and you can only be attuned to one Stormforged Weapon at a time. If you have multiple Stormforged Weapons, you can change which one you are attuned to during a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose your Stormforged Weapon or wish to create additional ones, you can do so over the course of three days (eight hours each day) by expending 200 gold pieces worth of metal and other raw materials. When you make a new Stormforged Weapon, you can make the same or different type, and select the same or different upgrades.</p>
            <p class="indent">Select one of the following and consult the Thunder Powered Weapon table for its statistics.</p>
            <h5>THUNDER CANNON</h5>
            <p>You use the power of Thunder to launch a projectile with terrible power, if limited accuracy, over long distances. Ringing out with a booming crash, it brings fear to the battlefield.</p>
            <h5>HAND CANNON</h5>
            <p>Forgoing the guiding barrel, this pack uses the thundering power to launch a projectile with all the force of a Cannon, though its effective range is far more limited.</p>
            <h5>KINETIC HAMMER</h5>
            <p>Rather than launching a projectile with the thundering force, you keep that force imbued in the weapon, allowing for devastating force to be applied to the attack.</p>
            <h5>CHARGED BLADE</h5>
            <p>You create a bladed weapon that channels the harnessed power of the elemental storm power directly into the blade, causing it to lay waste to all it strikes. This weapon deals Lightning damage when applying Thundermonger.</p>
            <h5>LIGHTNING PIKE</h5>
            <p>You create a charged blade and stick it to the end of a pole, making it slightly more unwieldy, but giving it devastating reach. This weapon deals Lightning damage when applying Thundermonger.</p>

            <description>You can attune to two one-handed Stormforged Weapons at the same time, so long as they either share the same Upgrades, or have total Upgrades equal to your maximum Upgrade count between them. If you make an attack with one of them while holding the other, you can attack with the other as a bonus action. Both share the same use of Thundermonger. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative or you have the Two Weapon Fighting Fighting Style. While dual wielding Stormforged Weapons, you can load a Stormforged Weapon without a free hand.</description>
