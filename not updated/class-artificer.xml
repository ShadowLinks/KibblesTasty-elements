        <description>
            <p>A gnome sits hunched over a workbench in a room cluttered with every sort of tool, carefully drawing the final lines to an intricate rune. With a crackling hum of arcane energy, the completed rune flares with power, and she watches with a smile of pride as the golem comes to life and stands.</p>
            <p class="indent">A troll growls in hunger as it looms over a dwarf, who slides a long, metal tube from a holster at his belt. With a thundering boom, a gout of energy erupts from the tube, and the troll's growls turn into shrieks of panic as it turns to flee.</p>
            <p class="indent">With a thunderous crash of energy a figure lands in the middle of the battlefield. As the smoke clears, a towering presence stands amidst the war-torn battlefield clad in glowing mechanical plate mail. The glowing visor swivels to inspect the wreckage. It raises a gauntlet, and lightning crackles forth.</p>
            <p class="indent">Makers of magic-infused objects, inventors are defined by their inventive nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of thorough study and investigation.</p>
            <p class="indent">Inventors, though, focus on creating marvelous new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable, useful items.</p>
            <h4>CUNNING INVENTORS</h4>
            <p>Every inventor is defined by a specific craft. Inventors see mastering the basic methods of a craft as the first step to true progress, the invention of new methods and approaches. Inventors are arcane engineers, students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, magical armor, and mechanical beings that they can augment with magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">All inventors are united by their curious and inventive nature. To an inventor, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year. Inventors value novelty and discovery. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.</p>
            <p class="indent">A hidden ruin might hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect for magical enhancement. Inventors win respect and renown among their kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of creation.</p>
            <h4>INTENSE RIVALRIES</h4>
            <p>The inventors’ drive to invent and expand their knowledge creates an intense drive to uncover new magic discoveries. An inventor who hears news of a newly discovered magic item must act fast to get it before any rivals do. Good-aligned inventors recover items on adventures or offer gold or wondrous items to those who possess items they are keen to own. Evil ones have no problem committing crimes to claim what they want.</p>
            <p class="indent">Almost every inventor has at least one rival, someone whom they seek to outdo at every turn. By the same token, inventors with similar philosophies and theories band together into loose guilds. They share their discoveries and work together to verify their theories and keep ahead of their rivals.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN Inventor</h4>
            <p>When creating an inventor character, think about your character's background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival? What drove your character down the path of being an inventor? Is it about curiosity and invention, or about the power their inventions bring? Did you character learn from another inventor, or receive a vision or flash of inspiration to learn their craft?</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider how your character interacts with the world, and what they represent. Consult with your DM regarding guilds or societies your character might belong to.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an inventor quickly by following these suggestions. For the Gadgetsmith or Thundersmith paths, make your highest attribute Dexterity, followed by Intelligence. For Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, or Potionsmith, Intelligence followed by Constitution or Dexterity, and for Warsmith or Fleshsmith, choose either Strength or Intelligence, with Constitution as your second highest attribute. Second, choose the Guild Artisan background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

        <description>
            <p>As part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells at 2nd level. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The inventor table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your inventor spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of your Inventor spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
            <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the inventor spell list. The Spells Known column of the Inventor table shows when you learn more Inventor spells of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Inventor spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Inventor spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

            <p class="indent">You select an additional Upgrade at 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th level. You cannot select an Upgrade more than once, unless the Upgrade's description says otherwise. Whenever you level up, you can exchange one of your existing upgrades for another upgrade of the same level requirement as the replaced upgrade.</p>
            <p class="indent">In any case an existing Upgrade is swapped out for a replacement Upgrade (either by a subclass feature or on level up), the new Upgrade is selected as if the Inventor is the level they were when they got that Upgrade slot. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th level Inventor, you could select one 3rd level upgrade and one 5th level upgrade, or two 3rd level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th level upgrades.</p>

            <p>You modify a crossbow to be able to aim and fire on its own. As an action, you can deploy a tiny construct. Once deployed, the tiny construct can be fired as a bonus action making an attack from where it is deployed with a range of 30/120 feet.

The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the rope (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the rope.</p></li>
                <li><p class="indent"><strong><em>Fasten.</em></strong> The rope flies up 60 feet and ties one end to an object or surface that a rope could be tied to, before becoming inanimate again, hanging from the object.</p></li>

If that object is being carried by a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On success, it retains the object, and on failure the object is pulled from the creature.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target a chain instead of a rope. It has the same available actions, but it has a DC 15, an AC of 15, and resistance to slashing damage when taking the Bind action. When cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher targeting a rope, that rope is magically imbued for 1 minute, gaining an DC of 15, an AC 20, and 20 hit points.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You touch a weapon and imbue it with power. Until the spell ends, the weapon becomes indescribably sharp, ignoring resistance to slashing damage, and gains the Siege property, dealing double damage to inanimate objects such as structures. If a weapon has a modifier of less than +3 to attack and damage rolls, its modifier becomes +3 to attack and damage rolls for the duration of the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, if a critical strike of this weapon would leave a creature with less than 50 hitpoints, the target creature is decapitated, killing it.</p>
