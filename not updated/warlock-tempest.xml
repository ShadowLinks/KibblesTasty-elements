            <p>You have made pact with a tempestuous being, born of wind and rain. An ancient elemental, powerful storm giant, or perhaps a demigod of disagreeable weather. What they sought through you may vary, but the mere touch of their powers causes the storm winds to bend the knee.</p>
            <p class="indent">Such powers tend to be far better at calling the chaotic power at their disposal than calming it, and many who ride the tempest will find the same is true for them, leaving destruction in their wake if they are not careful in how the use their power... if they even care about what remains in their wake.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, when you cast a spell of first level or higher on your turn, a storm begins to brew around you. The storm gains Storm Levels based equal to the level of the spell slot used. If you cast a spell while the storm is active, the storm level is increased by the level of the spell slot used (up to a maximum equal to your Charisma ability modifier).</p>
            <p class="indent">While a storm is active around you, you gain the following abilities based on how powerful the storm is:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>Storm Level</td><td>Effect</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>You can cast <i>gust</i> as a bonus action.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>You can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a ranged weapon attack made against a target within 15 feet of you.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>You are under the effect of <i>levitate</i></td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>If a creature ends their turn within 10 feet of you or strikes you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d8 lightning damage to them.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>You gain flying speed equal to your movement speed.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p class="indent">The storm loses 1 level each time you end your turn without casting a 1st level or higher spell. You can prevent the decay of storm by concentrating on maintaining the storm as if it were a spell for up to 1 minute after you last cast a spell 1st level or higher, provided you aren't concentrating on any other spells.</p>
