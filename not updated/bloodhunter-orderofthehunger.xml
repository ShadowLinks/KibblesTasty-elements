            <p>When one walks the path of using the power of evil to destroy evil, few options are drastic as those that introduce the Hunger into themselves to enhance their abilities.</p>
            <p class="indent">In an ancient and dark blood rite, Blood Hunters of this order consume that which consumes - they imbibe the blood of a vampire, mixing it with their own in a process that produces a cursed half-living half-undead hunter. Though horrific, the Hunger grants them strength and powers that allow them effective machines of destruction, hunting and destroying what haunts the shadows.</p>
            <p class="indent">If they don't become what haunts the shadows.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use a dark rite as a bonus action, awakening your vampiric blood. When you activate this rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your crimson rite die, and assume a vampiric form for 1 minute, or until you end it as an action, controlling your blood.</p>
            <p class='indent'>For the duration, your visage becomes pallid and vampiric, fangs lengthening and eyes turning a glowing red. You can see in dim light or darkness as if it is bright light, gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and your fangs become a natural weapon, which you can use once per turn to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, and necrotic damage equal to twice your Crimson Rite Die. You have advantage with this attack against targets you are grappling. If the target was a living creature of CR 1/4 or more that has blood, you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt up to the amount of hit points you had the end of your last turn.</p>
            <p class='indent'>This form suffers from some aspects of a vampire's cursed nature. If you start your turn in sunlight you take 1d4 radiant damage, and if you start your turn in running water, you take 1d4 acid damage. Any magical healing you receive from non-Necromancy spells is reduced by half.</p>
