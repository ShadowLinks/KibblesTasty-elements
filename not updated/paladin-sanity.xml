            <p>The Oath of Sanity is the oath of someone that has survived exposure to the horrors that lay beyond the veil.</p>
            <p class="indent">While most who have glimpsed into the Far Realm suffer instant and irrevocable madness, these Paladins have glimpsed beyond and sworn to remain sane, no matter what the cost. They reject shielding their fragile mind from what they've seen in comforting shroud of madness.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Oath of Sanity Paladin will usually seem to others as true neutral or lawful neutral following obscure codes incomprehensible to those who haven't experienced a brush with the beyond, their morality coming in blue and orange rather than black and white. Almost universally they are dedicated preventing the threats beyond from consuming the material world and shattering the fragile minds within.</p>
            <p class="indent">These are the ones who make grim decisions for the greater good, for they know what lies beyond.</p>
            <h5>TENETS OF SANITY</h5>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Order.</i></b> Never act on random or chaotic impulses. These are the cracks of madness.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Vigilance.</i></b> Never let your attention wander, least you miss the signs madness.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Discipline</i></b> Never indulge in a lapse of behavior, your habits keep you safe from madness.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Solemnity</i></b> Your work is terrible. Never take pleasure in it. That leads to the comfort of madness</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Sanity</i></b> No matter what, never give into madness.</p>

            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Turn the Aberrant:</em></strong> As an action, you can make any aberration or undead, provided that it's within 30 feet and that can see or hear you, make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Focus Mind:</em></strong> As a reaction to becoming Frightened, Charmed, or suffering a negative mental status inflicted by failing an Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw, you may focus your mind, expending your Channel Divinity to immediately end the effect.</p>
