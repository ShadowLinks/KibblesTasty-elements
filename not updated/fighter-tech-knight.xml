			<p>A Tech Knight believes that it is neither brains nor brawn that determine the best fighter, but the combination thereof. Why limit yourself to what nature has provided you when you can supplement your combat superiority in unique and inventive ways that give you the edge?</p>
            <p class="indent">You build and innovate on the cutting edge... and use that edge to hew through your foes. There are few things more dangerous than weaponized creativity in the hands of someone that knows how to use it.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Tech Knight could be called an inventor that opened the door of innovation, found the deadliest thing they could invent, and closed it once more, but that wouldn't be accurate - they innovate continuously, improving their art, just with a highly specialized focus.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some perhaps adventure and fight to test their weapons, others perhaps turned to innovation to overcome some obstacle or seek the change the world, and others still care little for the science and engineering of the weapon, and merely cobbled together something to annihilate their foes.</p>

        <description>
            <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you start to build tools to help you dominate the battlefield in unique ways. You can build one weapon. Select one weapon from the below list:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>Weapon</td><td>Damage</td><td>Properties</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>Chainblade</td><td>2d4 slashing</td><td>Versatile (3d4), Special</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Ramming Gauntlet</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>Light, Special</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Repeating Hand Crossbow</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>Ammunition (30/120), Light, Special</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Ricocheting Weapon</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>Finesse, Thrown (30/90), Special</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Transforming Weapon</td><td>2d6/1d8</td><td>Two-Handed, Heavy, Special</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p class="indent">You make the weapon you select and gain proficiency with it. When selecting a Ramming Gauntlet, you can make a matched set of them. Only you have proficiency with this weapon.</p>
            <h5>SPECIAL PROPERTIES</h5>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Chainblade.</em></strong> When you roll damage dice for this weapon, you can reroll as many damage dice as you would like once per attack, but you must use the new roll any dice rolled. After hitting an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action, if you have additional attacks you can make as part of the action, you can forgo them to deal an additional 3d4 slashing damage per attack forgone.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ramming Gauntlet.</em></strong> When you make an attack roll, you can choose to forgo adding your Proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can add double your Proficiency bonus to the damage roll.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Repeating Hand Crossbow.</em></strong> This weapon does not require a free-hand to load, as it has a built-in loader. Once per turn, if you make an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action, if you do not have disadvantage on that attack, you can give yourself disadvantage to make a single additional weapon attack with this weapon as a bonus action (also at disadvantage).</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ricocheting Weapon.</em></strong> When this weapon is thrown you can target two creatures within 10 feet of each other, making a separate attack roll against each target; the damage dealt is halved for targets hit after the first. This weapon returns to your hand after you make an attack with it using the Thrown property.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Transforming Weapon.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can convert this from a 2d6 melee weapon to a 1d8 ranged weapon with the Ammunition (100/400) property. When you convert the weapon, it becomes overcharged with power, and the next time you roll damage with it before the end of your turn you deal an additional 1d6 lightning damage. Select the damage type when creating this weapon from bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or lightning damage. You can select a different damage type for the melee and ranged forms.</p>
            <h5>REV UP</h5>
            <p>When hit an attack with your Brutal Invention, you can overcharge with an effect based on your Brutal Invention selection, granting it an additional benefit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Reckless Power (Chainblade):</em></strong> The weapon's damage dice become d6's for that attack (including the special property if activated).</li>
                <li><strong><em>Excessive Force (Ramming Gauntlet):</em></strong> The target is knocked 10 feet backwards.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Full Auto (Repeating Hand Crossbow):</em></strong> You immediately make single additional attack as part of the same action, rolling three d20s for the attack roll and taking the lowest.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Overcharge (Transforming Weapon):</em></strong> You deal an additional 1d6 lightning damage.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Hypervolicty (Ricocheting Weapon):</em></strong> The weapon bounces to an additional target.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, regaining all uses on a short or long rest.</p>
            <h5>WEAPON IMPROVEMENT</h5>
            <p>Additionally, over the course of a long rest, you can destroy a +1/+2/+3 magic weapon to transfer the bonus to attack and damage rolls to your Brutal Invention weapon. At the DMs discretion, other properties can be transferred (it is recommended that most cannot, but a final decision is up to the DM).</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Charged Armor.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can juice your armor with power with the effect of lightning charged.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Rocket Boots.</em></strong> As a bonus action you can activate these do give yourself a jumping distance equal to your movement speed until the end of the turn. You take no fall damage from this movement, but creatures of your choice within 5 feet of where you land take 2d4 fire damage. Alternatively, you can use this to cast feather fall targeting only yourself.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Belt.</em></strong> You can use this to cast enlarge/reduce without expend a spell slot.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Flame Thrower.</em></strong> As an action or in place of an attack as part of the Attack action, you can use this to cast burning hands as a 2nd level spell without expending a spell slot.</li>

                <li><strong><em>Thunder Grenade.</em></strong> As an action or in place of an attack as part of the Attack action, you can use this to cast shatter without expending a spell slot.</li>
