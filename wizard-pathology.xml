            <p>Curious minds delve in the mysteries of the world, and few hold more morbid fascination than the inner workings of diseases and plagues. Those that understand the nature of disease and pathogens are precious to any society, but at the same time shunned and feared as much as a necromancer might be for they deal in the darkest fears of many a village. It is often their superiority understanding of transmission that dooms their reputation, for arriving before the plague is widely understood oft leaves them the scapegoat of the superstitious.</p>
            <p class="indent">But superstitious are born from a seed of truth, and some of those that delve the mysteries of pathogens and diseases do so for the darkest of purposes, for with great knowledge comes great power.</p>
