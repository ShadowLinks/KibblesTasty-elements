        <description>
            <p>This tradition is a loose collection of magic users that benefit from a wide array of traditions and practical knowledge to build up a collection of eccentric magical knowledge. Their methods are often frowned upon by those of more studied routes, but their practical skills cannot be denied, and their unique understanding of magic that they have developed with their own hands and minds should not be underestimated.</p>

            <p>You gain proficiency in your choice of one of the following skills: Arcana, Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. Additionally you can select 1 additional cantrips of your choice from the occultist list, or from the following expanded cantrip spell list: blade ward, firebolt, mage hand, prestidigitation, friends, ray of frost, shillelagh, spare the dying, thaumaturgy, true strike. When you learn a new cantrip, you can select from the above expanded list in addition to the Occultst list.</p>
            <p class="indent">You learn your magic through self-discovery, often encompassing trial and error. Not knowing what is supposed to be impossible or impractical, your magic develops unique aspects. You can modify spells you learn with the following feature.</p>
            <h5>The Way I Learned It</h5>
            <p>When you learn a new spell, you can modify some its properties representing your unique way of casting that spell. These changes permanently effect the spell for you, but when you swap out a spell when gaining a level in the class, you can instead modify these properties from a spell you know. You can learn the same spell multiple times with different selections (i.e. "ranged cure wounds")</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Damage Type.</strong> You can change any of the following damage types into another the damage types. Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison.</li>
                <li><strong>Range.</strong> You can make a spell with a range of 10 feet or more have a range of Touch, or give a spell with a range of Touch a range of up 10 feet (if it was a melee spell attack and it becomes a ranged spell attack if the range is greater than Touch).</li>
                <li><strong>Components.</strong> You can exchange a verbal, somatic, or material component of a spell for another type of component the spell does not normally have. Material components with a cost cannot be replaced, but can be exchanged for a different material component of equal cost.</li>
