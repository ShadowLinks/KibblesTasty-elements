        <description>
            <p>This tradition is a loose collection of magic users that benefit from a wide array of traditions and practical knowledge to build up a collection of eccentric magical knowledge. Their methods are often frowned upon by those of more studied routes, but their practical skills cannot be denied, and their unique understanding of magic that they have developed with their own hands and minds should not be underestimated.</p>

            <p>As you delve into your Tradition of occult magic, you find deviations and branches to explore that help you specialize and perfect your craft in the way that best suits you.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 2nd Level, you gain two occult rites of your choice. Your occult rites options are detailed at the end of the occult tradition description for tradition specific Rites, and at the end of the class description for general rites. You can select from either your tradition or class list. When you gain certain Occultist levels, you gain additional occult rites of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the occult rites you know and replace it with another occult rite that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in an occult rite refers to Occultist level, not character level.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You learn your magic through self-discovery, often encompassing trial and error. Not knowing what is supposed to be impossible or impractical, your magic develops unique aspects. You can modify spells you learn with the following feature.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you learn a new Occultist spell, you can modify some of its properties representing your unique way of casting that spell. These changes permanently affect the spell for you, but when you swap out a spell when gaining a level in the class, you can instead modify these properties from a spell you know. You can learn the same spell multiple times with different selections (i.e. “ranged cure wounds”) You may apply any number of these properties when learning or modifying a spell.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Damage Type.</strong> You can change any of the following damage types into another of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.</li>
                <li><strong>Range.</strong> You can make a spell with a range of 10 feet or more instead have a range of Touch, or give a spell with a range of Touch a range of up 10 feet (if it was a melee spell attack, it becomes a ranged spell attack if the range is greater than Touch).</li>
                <li><strong>Components.</strong> You can exchange a verbal, somatic, or material component of a spell for another type of component the spell does not normally have, such as changing a spell from requiring verbal and somatic components, to requiring somatic and material components. Material components with a cost cannot be replaced, but can be exchanged for a different material component of equal cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>If using this feature, you should create your own custom spells.</em></strong></p>

        <description>
            <p>Additionally, your self-taught casting style has resulted in some practical advantages. Select one of the following casting styles:</p>
            <p><strong></strong>Reliable Casting. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an Occultist cantrip, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>
            <p><strong></strong>Habitual Casting. When you cast an Occultist cantrip that requires concentration, you can instead cause the effect to persist without concentration a number of rounds equal to your Occultist level (for example, as 1st level Occultist, it would end at the start of your next turn). You can end a spell persisting in this way early as an action.</p>
            <p><strong></strong>Tactical Casting. When you take the Ready action with an Occultist cantrip, it does not require concentration to keep the spell readied.</p>
