            <p>A brawler is a fighter that takes a holistic approach to beating things down. They are not the specialized martial artists of monks, but can throw a punch... or a chair. They specialize in being resourceful and, more importantly, strong. Ranging from brutish thugs and drunks to witty chaps who had to learn to wag their fists as fast as their tongue to keep their head on their shoulders.</p>
            <p class="indent">A brawler is always armed and dangerous, and isn’t above using a weapon if it’s the handiest way to bash something; they just don’t view themselves as limited to traditional options.</p>

            <p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a remarkable ability to turn anything into a weapon—fists, improvised weapons, goblins, etc.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with improvised weapons, and all attacks you make with them deal 1d8 damage bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (depending on their nature) if their damage die would be smaller. You can use creatures you are grappling as improvised weapons with the Thrown 5/10 property. If they are one or more sizes smaller than you, they gain the Light property. When you make an attack using a creature or object as a weapon, you can choose to deal damage equal to your Strength modifier to the creature or object you are using as a weapon.</p>
