            <p>Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.</p>
