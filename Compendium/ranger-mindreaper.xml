        <description>
            <p>Mind Reapers are an incarnation of fear. Terrible creatures seen more often in stories told to frighten children or ancient legends than the material plane, these are predatory creatures most mortals would be right to fear, no matter what their intentions.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some use these powers to spread fear, savoring the terror of their victims. Others use their powers to dispense what they view as justifice, stalking down and reaping only those they believe have earned such a grim fate.</p>
