        <description>
            <p>Occultists are those that follow the old ways: a path of ritual and wisdom long known yet oft forgotten. Rather than force magic to obey, they bind, twist, manipulate, and compromise with it. They follow ancient agreements and techniques to produce results that few fully understand, even those that use them, but that they know it will work, for it always has.</p>
            <h4>ANCIENT TRADITIONS</h4>
            <p>Occultists are spellcasters following legacies that go far back. While they may or may not be directly tutored or influenced by another member of their tradition, their path to magic involves unearthing ancient secrets, old ways, and knowledge gleaned from spirits, ghosts, and elementals.</p>
            <p class="indent">They often personify aspects of their magic in ways that other casters find odd, coaxing and manipulating magic forces by ancient laws and bargains. Occultists tread between the arcane and the divine, not necessarily worshiping any god, but treating gods and spirits alike with cautious respect for their domains, asking for what they take, and carefully giving thought to their actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each tradition that appears in the Occultist is an ancient legacy of magic, found deep within folklore and story. Every villager could tell you stories of Occultists and their traditions, and they are often seen in this context. Though villagers and the superstitious might fear them and their magic, they may be more likely to turn to them than a Wizard; at least an Occultist makes sense to them, even if they are scared by their powers.</p>
            <h4>SPIRITUAL MAGIC</h4>
            <p>A common thread of the magic wielded by the Occultist is the spiritual connection of it; the demidivine nature of magic that taps into the weave of magic, oft through intermediaries such as gods, spirits, elementals, and more.</p>
            <p class="indent">Frequently an Occultist may call upon their magic through the mediums of spirits quite directly, even having names for the spirits it calls about to bring about certain magical effects. The verbal component of an Occultist’s spell might be calling upon a spirit to work their wish, an invocation of their ancient bargain, or words in a language designed to bind and persuade.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN OCCULTIST</h4>
            <p>When creating an Occultist, the most important decision will be what Tradition you follow. Each Tradition of an Occultist is distinct, with divergent flavor and calling upon a different aspect of folklore.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose a background that lives on the fringes of society. Third, choose the chill touch, guidance, and poison spray cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells: burning hands, cure wounds, and hideous laughter.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an Occultist, you gain the following class features.</p>

        <description>
            <p>>As a practitioner of occult magic, you have inherited and developed techniques to manipulate reality through mediums of rituals, spirits, elements, and more. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Occultist spell list.</p>
            <h4>Cantrips</h4>
            <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Occultist spell list. You learn additional Occultist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Occultist table.</p>
            <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
            <p>The Occultist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Occultist spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell lightning tendril and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast lightning tendril using either slot.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Occultist spells. Your magic comes from a practitioner’s knowledge of tradition, ritual, and the way things work learned through experience, care, and cunning. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Occultist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
            <p>You can cast any Occultist spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
            <p>You can use an occult fetish as a spellcasting focus for your Occultist spells.</p>
        </description>
        <sheet>
            <description>You can cast rituals of Occultist Spells that have the ritual tag. You can use an Occult Fetish as a spellcasting focus.</description>

            <p>As you delve into your Tradition of occult magic, you find deviations and branches to explore that help you specialize and perfect your craft in the way that best suits you.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 2nd Level, you gain two occult rites of your choice. Your occult rites options are detailed at the end of the occult tradition description for tradition specific Rites, and at the end of the class description for general rites. You can select from either your tradition or class list. When you gain certain Occultist levels, you gain additional occult rites of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the occult rites you know and replace it with another occult rite that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in an occult rite refers to Occultist level, not character level.</p>

            <p>At 20th level, your mastery of ritual and tradition is extensive and unparalleled; you’ve unlocked ancient secrets and perfected techniques to master rituals completely. Any Occultist spell you know of 3rd level or lower becomes a ritual spell for you. When you cast a spell without the ritual tag as a ritual, it requires additional consumed material components worth 10 gold per level of the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, your mastery of rituals allows you to work them more quickly. A spell cast as a ritual only takes additional turns equal to the spell’s level to cast (for example, casting a 3rd level spell as a ritual would take four turns to cast, casting as your action or bonus action on the fourth turn). Spells with a casting time of a reaction cannot be cast as a ritual.</p>
