        <description>
            <p>The warped are members of races that have been deeply influenced by the powers from beyond, twisting their mind and body with mysterious power that has left them fundamentally changed.</p>
            <h4>TWISTED ORIGIN</h4>
            <p>Most often this comes from long exposure, sometimes only manifesting in creatures born under its influence, but there are those that have been warped later in life, generally by more direct interactions with the creatures that lurk beyond the veil of sanity.</p>
            <p class="indent">Many of the warped fall to madness, unable to escape the whispering voices and strange visions, but ones that become adventurers have managed to learn to live with their condition, and consequently have minds of steel.</p>
            <h4>Warped Traits</h4>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Warped Origin.</em></strong>  Select an existing race option. You gain the creature type, size, and languages of that race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> An warped creature can be any alignment, but have a inclination toward chaotic alignments.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Inured of Madness.</em></strong> Things that cause madness in others seem relatively benign to you. You have resistance to psychic damage. You automatically pass any saves against madness</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Inner Voice.</em></strong> You have an inner voice that doesn’t belong to you, frequently muttering nonsense, but occasionally offering useful advice, letting you add 1d6 to any ability check you make. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses at the end of a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Warped Gift.</em></strong> Your condition grants you one special trait. Some may view it as a curse or burden, but you’ve adapted to using it to your advantage. Select one of the following options:</p>
            <ul><li>Warped Eyes, Warped Limb, Warped Mind, Warped Skin, Warped Form</li></ul>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You have learned to understanding the whispering voices you hear. You learn Deep Speech.</p>
