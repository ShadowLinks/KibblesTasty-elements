        <description>
            <p>A Relicsmith is a strange brand of Inventor, often viewed with skepticism by their peers, but bolstered by one simple fact: the inventions work. They harness holy power in ways that defy arcane logic, bringing a unique blend of methodology and faith. How their inventions work is a source of consternation to others, but their faith in their scriptures and inscriptions is rewarded... perhaps by the faith they have in them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Relicsmiths are inheritors of ancient traditions, sometimes passed down to them, sometimes ones they have uncovered in their research... sometimes, perhaps, ones that they believe they have uncovered in their research. Patterns, connections, scriptures, and rituals, their tools are many and varied.</p>
            <p class="indent">Of course, those that walk this path tend to have strong conviction which extends beyond just their invention. A Relicsmith is as prone as any Paladin to have a driven and righteous (in their eyes) cause. Divine power in those restrained only by their own conviction can be a dangerous thing indeed.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you integrate your Relic into another item, selecting one of the following for your Relic. Your Relic retains all the properties it normally has, and gains new properties based on the selected item. Once selected, you can’t select a different option, but can replace the weapon your relic is incorporated into during a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Melee Weapon</h5>
            <p class="indent">You integrate your divine relic into a melee weapon. The weapon taps directly into the relic’s power. If you use your Divine Relic to ignite it, it adds an extra 1d6 fire damage (instead of 1d4). Setting a weapon integrated with your relic ablaze can be done as part of the Attack action.</p>
            <h5>Ranged Weapon</h5>
            <p class="indent">You integrate your divine relic into a ranged weapon, giving it an unlimited supply of sacred power to use as ammunition. It no longer consumes ammunition and instead fires radiant bolts of power, dealing radiant damage. If the weapon has the loading property, it is removed.</p>
            <h5>Relic Lantern</h5>
            <p class="indent">You power a sacred lantern with the divine relic, causing it to shed a brilliant pure light for 20-foot radius and an additional 20 feet of dim light. As a bonus action, you can grant one creature within the light of the lantern 1d4 temporary hit points.</p>

            <p>With careful inscription and rituals you create a divine device that focuses the holy power of a particular domain. At the time of selecting this upgrade, select a cleric domain. This device can be used to activate that domain’s Channel Divinity feature once, after which it can’t be used again until you finish a long rest. Your Inventor level is your Cleric level for the purpose of calculating any bonuses to it.</p>
