            <p>Few paths are as demanding as the oath of these dauntless doggos, for they walk not just the path of being good, but being the goodest. These are no man’s second best friend, but man’s best friend itself, in the fur. They allow no evil to go unbarked, no stick to go unfetched, and no tail to go unwagged.</p>
            <p class="indent">This prestigious path is so precarious that only a doggo could hope to tread it, though the forms of the doggo are many, from your everyday goodest bois working hard to do their best, to perhaps more erudite awakened doggos, or even demigods in doggo form.</p>

            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity option.</p>
            <p><strong>Bark the Evil:</strong> As an action, you can unleash a ferocious storm of holy barks to drive away evil. All non-allied creatures within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 round or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the creature is on your property, it has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>
            <p><strong>To the Rescue:</strong> As a reaction to an allied creature being reduced to zero hit points, you can run up to your movement speed toward that creature and if you can reach it, you can use your Lay on Paws feature as part of the reaction, as long as you have at least 1 point of hit points left to restore with it.</p>
