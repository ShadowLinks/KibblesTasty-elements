        <description>
            <p>A truly unique Path, this is often defined by its exact nature, but such a nature varies widely. Perhaps it is a lost piece of technology, such as long dead Warsmith’s cast off armor that has developed strange properties, or perhaps it is an alien symbiote of some kind, with its own goal or objective (perhaps as simple as harmlessly feeding off your rage or your foes).</p>
            <p class="indent">You can select one of the options from the table below or work with your GM to make an entirely new concept. It can be biological or mechanical in nature, or could even be part of your race or origin. Perhaps it is something you find or something you make, but whatever its origin, it grants you terrifying capabilities on the battlefield.</p>

                <tr><td>3</td><td>A crystalline suit that phases into existence from a gem-like pendant.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>A set of mystical runes that cover your body.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>A mechanical suit of armor that becomes integrated into your body</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>A sentient set of armor that walks around, equipping itself to you in combat.</td></tr>

            <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you become bonded to the exosuit, though you need not necessarily always be wearing it. You are permanently connected to it in some way, and even if it is lost or destroyed, it recovers itself through its bond to you.</p>
            <p class="indent">In its dormant state, it has a small collapsed form, recedes into your body, or has no form at all (based on its nature). When you enter a rage, it is activated, becoming a complete suit of armor. It subsumes whatever armor you are wearing when it activates, adopting the AC of that armor (if you are not wearing armor, it has the AC of your Unarmored Defense). In addition, it grants you the following properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regenerating Armor. </strong>Your exosuit protects you from blows, reducing the damage you take by your proficiency bonus.</li>
                <li><strong>Iron Fists.</strong> If you are not carrying anything in your hand, that hand is treated as a weapon that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage with the light property.</li>
                <li><strong>Smashing Force.</strong> Whenever you succeed on an Athletics (Strength) check to shove or grapple a creature, you can deal 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage to the target creature.</li>
