        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 1st level, you gain the ability to unleash blasts of primal draconic energy from your hand or mouth. As an action, you can unleash this power in a 15 foot cone or a 30 foot long, 5 foot wide line. Invocations that apply to eldritch blast also apply to Draconic Blast, though Eldritch Spear has a special interaction, making it a 30 foot cone or 60 foot long, 5 foot wide line.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you gain this feature, select one damage type of acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Creatures in the area of effect must make a Dexterity saving throw, or take 1d8 elemental damage of the selected type. This feature’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level in Warlock (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use this ability, you can expend a pact magic spell slot to empower the draconic blast, dealing 1d8 additional damage per level of the pact magic slot expended. When empowered, it deals half damage even against creatures that pass their saving throw against it.</p>

            <p>As an action, you can grow draconic claws on one or both hands, lasting until you dismiss them as an action.</p>
            <p class="indent">This claws count as your pact weapon. While the claws are formed, you cannot use a weapon or shield in the hand they are manifested in. These are natural weapons that deal 1d6 slashing damage. When you form claws in both hands, if you make an attack with your claws, you can make one additional weapon attack with them as a bonus action. When you attack with your claws, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, the claws gain a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. These benefits (Charisma, attack and damage bonus, and counting the natural weapons as your pact weapon) also applies to any natural weapons you gain through the Dragon Subclass (such as Dragon Form). You can sacrifice a martial weapon with a bonus greater than +1 to attack and damage rolls to your patron, permanently destroying it. When you do so, the bonus to attack and damage rolls of your claws increases to that of the sacrificed weapon. Your DM has the final say of which weapons can be sacrificed in this way, and if any other properties are gained from the ritual.</p>
