            <p>A Cursesmith’s power is invariably marked by the dark decisions they’ve made; some ignore this lingering darkness, pursuing the heights of power their reckless creation allows. Others leverage the twisted side effects themselves, believing there are no mistakes, only opportunities. Darker still are those that truly embrace the darkness of their twisted creations, becoming twisted creations themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Cursesmith is not always evil, but they walk a path that dangles precariously over evil, making it an easy thing to fall into. They may be lawful, but the laws they respect are rarely those of normal mortal society that might get in the way of their dark delving.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, you set yourself apart from other Inventors by seizing power that others dare not wield. You partake in a dark ritual investing enormous power and a part of your soul into a weapon. The weapon becomes permanently bound to you. You have proficiency with the weapon. If the weapon is lost or destroyed, you can reform it by drawing on its connection to your soul. This is a special ritual that takes 1 day, and summons the weapon to you if it was lost, or recreates it if it was destroyed.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you perform the rite, select two of the following upgrades: Empowered Artifact, Abhorrent Life, Grasping Form, Twisting Reach, Necrotic Wounding, or Eldritch Eruption. You can select additional properties as Upgrades, but your Forbidden Artifact can have a maximum number of these Upgrades equal to your proficiency bonus (meaning the first time you can select an additional property is 5th level).</p>

At the start of your turn while you are not incapacitated you gain temporary hit points equal to 1 + the number of cursed items you have consumed with this ability. If you are under the effect of bane, this becomes 1d4 + the number of cursed items you have consumed with this ability.
            Additionally, when you gain temporary hit points from this feature, you can instead regain hit points equal to the temporary hit points you would have gained. You can regain hit points this way {{proficiency}} times, regaining all uses on a long rest.

            <p>You create a ring that can store a fragment of corrupted power. As an action, you can infuse an Inventor spell you know (including spells gained from upgrades) with a casting time of 1 action into the ring. You cast the spell as normal (expending the spell slot if it is 1st level or higher) but the spell doesn’t take effect, and is stored in the ring for later use. When you take the Attack action while a spell is stored in your ring, you may replace one attack with the stored spell. You may also release the stored spell directly, casting it at its normal casting time. A stored spell fades if you remove the ring, or if it is unused at the end of a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em>Curse:</em> When you store a spell in your ring, your current and maximum hit points are reduced by 1 + the level of the spell (1 for a cantrip).</p>
