        <description>
            <p>Monks of the Way of the Sword Saint train in dedication to mastering a level of weapon expertise that surpasses normal limitations. They can strike like the wind, step into the sky, or even sunder stone. Though they most often treat their mastery of the weapons as an art, seeking spiritual understanding through martial perfection, turning this art to more practical ends can result in very deadly encounters for their foes.</p>

            <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn Mystical Techniques that allow you to unleash supernatural feats with your weapons. You learn three techniques of your choice, which are detailed in the “List of Mystic Techniques” section below. You learn two additional techniques of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Mystical Techniques can only be performed with unarmed strikes or monk weapons. If a Mystical Technique uses a DC, it uses your Ki Save DC.</p>
