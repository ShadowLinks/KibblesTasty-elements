        <description>
            <p>A Fleshsmith is a discomfiting presence in a group. Even when encountered in the most ideal circumstances, they simply have a lingering gaze that says "How could I improve that?" when they look at you.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Fleshsmith is a peculiar path of Inventor that has turned their creative talents... inward. They seek to understand and improve the limitations of flesh. All too frequently they place a slightly different value on aesthetics than others might, tending to find beauty primarily in efficiency.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Fleshsmith tends to be more eccentric than inclined to any particular alignment, though even the most benevolent ones may find that the only reason their activities wouldn’t be illegal is that no one considered them possible.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, you select an approach to your work, a specialization to your art form. Select one of the following options:</p>
            <h5>Perfection of Form</h5>
            <p class="indent">Nature had its chance to make your form, now it’s your turn to improve it. When you take this path, you gain the Fleshcrafted Mutation upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total. Additionally, when an upgrade calls to use your spell save DC, you can instead use 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you take the Attack action, you can use your bonus action to make a single additional attack with this upgrade. You can make this additional attack a number of times equal to your Inventor level. You regain all uses at the end of a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Perfection of Mind</h5>
            <p class="indent">You know that perfection is an aspect of knowledge, a perfect understanding of the mechanics of the body, inside and out. But particularly inside. You gain expertise in the Medicine skill. Additionally, you gain the Dissection upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total.</p>
            <p class="indent">You have a pool of d8s equal to your Inventor level. When you restore hit points to a creature or use an Intelligence (Medicine) check to deal damage to a creature, you can expend these d8s to restore additional health or deal additional damage. You can spend a number equal to your proficiency bonus at a time. You regain this pool of d8s at the end of a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Perfection of Creation</h5>
            <p class="indent">Why let the gods have all the fun? You’ve created life. When you take this path, you gain the Adorable Critter upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your Adorable Critter gains temporary hit points equal to your Inventor level + your Intelligence modifier each time you finish a short or long rest. Your Adorable Critter gains a natural weapon using your spell attack modifier dealing 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier piercing damage, though as normal it can’t independently take the Attack action. You can apply any upgrade you take to your Adorable Critter instead of yourself.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you can cause your Adorable Critter to move up to 10 feet and take the Attack action using your spell attack modifier to hit (requiring no action from the familiar). Additionally, you can also do this as a bonus action a number of times equal to your Inventor level and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Perfection of Technique</h5>
            <p class="indent">Others may call themselves “flesh smiths” or “flesh crafters”, but you are a flesh artist. Flaying, dicing, deboning, you’ve mastered it all. When you select this thesis option, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and gain the Flaying Hook upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total. You can integrate your Flaying Hook into another weapon, attaching its heavy chain to the hilt of your weapon, allowing you to attack with either weapon, and being considered to be wielding both when wielding one. Any magical bonus to attack and damage rolls the attached weapon is also applied to the Flaying Hook (if higher).</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use your Flaying Hook to pull a target or pull yourself toward a target, you can use your bonus action to make a single weapon attack against it. You can do this a number of times equal to your Inventor level and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest.</p>

            <description>A metal hook attached to a chain. You are proficient with this melee weapon, and it has the Special property. It deals 1d6 piercing damage.
            This weapon has a range of 20 feet. When you hit a target that is more than 5 feet away from you, if the target is Medium or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by its Strength (Athletics) to pull the target toward you. On a successful check, a Small or smaller target is pulled to you, and a Medium target is pulled half the distance (rounding up) toward you. The creature takes 1 additional damage for each 5 feet it is pulled.
            If the creature is Medium or larger, when you hit a target more than 5 feet away from you you can pull yourself up to 10 feet toward the target.</description>
