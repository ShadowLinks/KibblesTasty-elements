        <description>
            <p>Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to sprout a Sapling, rather than assuming a beast form. The Sapling to sprouts to life in an empty space you can see within 30 feet. The Sapling is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Sapling stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>
            <p class="indent">In combat, the Sapling shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. You can command your Sapling as part of the same bonus action used to summon it. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the Sapling can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. When you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your Sapling.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Sapling manifests for 10 minutes, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.</p>
