        <description>
            <p>Wardens are not born of civilization and order. Though some Wardens will seek to defend such things (or at least tolerate them), they are those that have harnessed primal chaotic powers. Lashing, roiling forces of untamed energy, that left unchecked would wash civilization from the face of the material plane as if it were but a temporary blip.</p>
            <h4>Aspects of Power</h4>
            <p>The powers of a Warden are expressions of deep and primal forces. They are power given sentience and will, entropy and destruction harnessed and focused to purpose and cause. They channel their power as a conduit, bringing it to heel through force of will and inner conviction. As a blacksmith forges a lump of iron to take on the keen edge of a sword, a Warden must always refine their power, tame and temper it to be a force of change rather than raw destruction.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>Chosen Powers</h4>
            <p>While the situations that lead a Warden to take up their mantle of powers varies widely, their powers are reflections of who they are, a synchronization that would be impossible to thrust upon those that did not choose their path. A Warden may feel they had no choice but to embrace their primal powers and wield them for a cause, but at the heart of the power is a choice: a choice to fight, a choice to stand, and a choice to be a champion.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>CREATING A WARDEN</h4>
            <p>When creating a Warden consider the factors that have led them down their path. A mortal connected to deep primal powers isn’t a common thing. Is this something your character sought out to right an ancient wrong, or something dropped in their lap they now have to deal with? How do you want to use this power, and what principles will you have?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>To make a Warden quickly, first place your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution and Wisdom. Second, choose a wilderness-related background.</p>
