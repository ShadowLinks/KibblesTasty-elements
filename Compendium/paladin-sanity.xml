        <description>
            <p>The Oath of Sanity is the oath of someone that has survived exposure to the horrors that lay beyond the veil, or perhaps someone that has prepared for them through a mystical order, a forgotten tradition... or particularly vivid and over active imagination.</p>
            <p class="indent">While most who have glimpsed into the realms beyond suffer instant and irrevocable madness, these Paladins have glimpsed beyond and sworn to remain sane, no matter what the cost. They reject shielding their fragile mind from what they’ve seen in a comforting shroud of madness.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Oath of Sanity Paladin will usually seem to others as true neutral or lawful neutral following obscure codes incomprehensible to those who haven’t experienced a brush with the beyond, their morality coming in blue and orange rather than black and white. Almost universally they are dedicated to preventing the threats from beyond from consuming the material world and shattering the fragile minds within.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">TENANTS OF SANITY</h5>
            <p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Sanity vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Order</i></b>
                Never act on random or chaotic impulses. These are the cracks of madness.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Vigilance</i></b>
                Never let your attention wander, lest you miss the signs of madness.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Discipline</i></b>
                 Never indulge in a lapse of behavior, your habits keep you safe from madness.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Solemnity</i></b>
                Your work is terrible. Never take pleasure in it. That leads to the comfort of madness
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Sanity</i></b>
                 No matter what, never give into madness.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Turn the Abberant.</strong> As an action, you can make any aberration or undead, provided that it’s within 30 feet and that can see or hear you, make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>
            <p><strong>Deny the Supernatural.</strong> Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action to attempt to strip the target of its powers. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or be unable to cast spells or use psionic abilities until the end of its next turn.</p>
