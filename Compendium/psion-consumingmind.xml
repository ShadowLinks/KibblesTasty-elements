        <description>
            <p>A Consuming Mind is a master of a dangerous branch of psionics, born from the ability to sap energy from other creatures. This power can tear away thoughts, minds, and ultimately vitality for the psion’s own consumption. A feared branch of psionics, it is sometimes believed to be one of the primeval roots of all psionic power, as it can be found among mind-eating monsters and ancient psionic space whales... which might have other names in various settings.</p>
            <p class="indent">It has been refined by those that seek greater power either from ambition or desperation, and unlocks a terrible but effective path. One example of mortal creatures walking this path are the houses of dark elves, who developed their dark powers from their study of feral, vampiric, brain-eating mosters.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 1st level, your powers grant you intuition that allows you to better adapt and survive as a mind hunter. You gain proficiency in Stealth and Deception. If you are already proficient in either skill, you instead become proficient in a skill of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use psionic abilities, you can make an Intelligence (Deception) check contested by a target’s Wisdom (Insight) to conceal your use of psionic powers from them, suppressing the ability’s usual visible indicators. If you spend psi points on the ability, you must subtract the psi points spent from your Intelligence (Deception) roll result (concealing greater uses of psionics being more difficult).</p>

            <p>Starting at 14th level, your Mind Leech ability always gains the Shredding modifier, and it doesn’t cost a psi point to add the modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">Further, you can use additional power to leave their mind further vulnerable. You can spend additional psi points on the Shredding modifier to further reduce their next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw (up to 2 additional points to reduce it by a total of 3d4). Once this effect has been applied to a creature, you can’t spend additional psi points on the Shredding modifier against the creature until 1 hour has passed.</p>
