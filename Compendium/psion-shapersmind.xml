            <p>A Shaper is a Psion that specializes in the materialization of their imagination, projecting it out into the world. No mere conjurers borrowing the powers of other planes, a Shaper manifests things from nothing but their own mind, weaving their creations into existence through the exertion of raw psionic power and imagination.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Shaper’s mind is a tool of nearly unrivaled power possessing both boundless creativity and inexorable will, but if that will is overrun, the world would do well to fear a Shaper’s nightmares.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 1st level, when you conjure your Astral Construct, you can apply one of the following powers to it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Devastating Weapons.</strong> You imagine more deadly armaments—from a greatsword to vicious fangs—causing your Astral Construct to grow more deadly. The Astral Construct’s damage becomes 1d12</li>
                <li><strong>Psionic Conduit.</strong> You can use your psionic powers, spells, talents through your Astral Construct, as if you were in its space.</li>
                <li><strong>Vivid Existence.</strong> Your Astral Construct fully materializes and automatically uses Solidify at the start of your turn without requiring a command to do so.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You can change which benefit you grant it for the duration of the effect as a bonus action.</p>

            <p>Starting at 10th level, when you would take damage while you have an Astral Construct within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to conjure it to you (sharing your space) and expend 1 psi point to Solidify it, transposing it between you and the source of damage. It takes the damage instead of you. If the attack deals more damage than it has hit points (from Solidify), you take the remainder of the damage.</p>

            <p>Starting at 14th level, you can allow your mind to run wild, letting an astral army spring forth into reality. When you use Replicate, you can create one additional Astral Construct that can be controlled with the same action (commands still only affect one Astral Construct of your choice). This additional construct lasts until the start of your next turn and can’t be sustained. Once you create an additional duplicate, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
