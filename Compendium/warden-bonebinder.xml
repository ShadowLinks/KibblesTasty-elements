            <p>Commanding the dark powers of the fallen, a Bone Warden watches over the endless and final silence of the end of life. Solemn and grim, they recycle the remains of life to one final service, binding the bones of once living creatures to form their armor, weapons, and grim constructs to bind and crush those that stand in their way of their primal decrees.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, as an action you can call forth a grim construct of bones that bursts from the ground in an empty space within 10 feet of you. It has the following stat block. It shares your turn, but cannot take any actions unless you use your action to direct it to take the Dodge action, Dash action, or take an action listed in its stat block. In addition to the actions in a stat block, it can follow simple instructions and perform simple tasks out of combat, but cannot communicate or execute complicated directions on its own. If you give it no directions, it stands still or follows you if you are more than 30 feet from it. When you gain the Extra Attack feature, you can replace one attack you can make with directing your Bone Construct to take an action.</p>
            <p class="indent">Its Strength (indicated in its stat block as a *) is equal to your Strength or Wisdom ability score (your choice).</p>
            <p class="indent">If it is more than 120 feet from you or reduced to zero hit points, it crumbles to dust. You can dismiss your Construct at any time as a bonus action, causing crumble to dust and await your call again.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your Bone Construct’s hit points are maintained between summons, but if it has less than your Warden level in hit points (such as if it was previously destroyed by being reduced to 0 hit points), it gains hit points equal to your Warden level when you spend your action calling it, and regains all of its hit points when you complete a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your Bone Constructs Slam damage die is increased in size by any effect that increases the size of your natural weapon damage dice.</p>

            <description>as an action, you can call for skeletal grasping hands to raise from the ground and bind your foes. All Large or smaller creatures of your choice within range of your Primal Interdiction (or the Primal Interdiction of your Bone Construct) must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Strength or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + {{proficiency}}.
            On failure, the creature becomes Restrained by a skeletal hand rising from the earth. The creature can break free as an action by making a Strength saving throw with the same DC as the original save, or can be freed if the skeletal hand is destroyed. It has an AC of 13 and 13 hit points, with a vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.
            If a creature ends its turn while restrained by a skeletal hand from this ability, it takes 3d6 necrotic damage.

            <p>Starting at 17th level, as a bonus action you can project your domain around you for 1 minute, with the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expanded Domain.</strong> The range of your Primal Interdiction is doubled.</li>
                <li><strong>Spare the Dying.</strong> If an allied creature falls to 0 hit points within range of your Primal Interdiction, you can cast spare the dying on them as a reaction (without needing to be able to touch them).</li>
                <li><strong>Boneyard.</strong> Skeletal constructs you create (including your Bone Construct, skeletal hands from Grave Grip, objects created by spells such as ribcage, or skeletons created by spells such as animate dead) gain resistance to all damage while within range of your Primal Interdiction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
