        <description>
            <p>Your innate magic comes from a bloodline tainted by fiendish influence of the lower planes. How directly this blood is inherited varies wildly. Perhaps your lineage includes a Warlock that has made some infernal pact, or you may even have a fiend in your family tree. Such blood lines can express themselves more strongly throughout generations in unpredictable ways. Sometimes it is merely the product of some sort of corruption, perhaps before you were even born.</p>
            <p class="indent">The influence is most often seen in races that have obvious fiendish heritage, such as tieflings, but it is not inherently tied to them.</p>
