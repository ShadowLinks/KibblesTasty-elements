        <description>
            <p>Legends tell of warriors that fight at the front of a legion, of the valor they display and the inspiration it gives their comrades. A Paragon before their army is a dauntless foe, and an army behind their Paragon is an unstoppable legion.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Paragon is not inherently good or evil. An evil legion can be led by a bold and charismatic Warlord just as effectively as the forces of good.</p>
            <p class="indent">As they tend to be those that inspire an organized force, more often than not they will be lawful, but what that personal code of laws entails can vary quite widely.</p>
