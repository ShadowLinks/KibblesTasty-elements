            <p>The College of Fools is a motley lot, varying from bumbling beggars to the eyesores of a noble court, decked out in the finest eye-bleeding frippery. One can tell at a glance they are not to be taken seriously, but beneath the facade there is... well, usually a fool, but also a sharp mind, quick hands, and an uncanny understanding of how to manipulate any situation.</p>
            <p class="indent">The College of Fools is tolerated much like an assassin’s guild might be: a useful menace to society. Hiding in the brilliant outfits in plain sight more surely than darkened leather could hide them in the shadows, they gather information, poke and prod their enemies, and—just occasionally—toss a knife in the air and forget to catch it before it hits someone.</p>

            <p>When you join the College of Fools at 3rd level, you master the art of juggling almost anything. You gain proficiency in Performance (or another skill of your choice if you already proficient in it).</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can draw or stow any number of items or weapons during your turn. You can hold more weapons or objects than you have hands, but when you do so, at the end of your turn you must make Dexterity (Performance) check with a DC of 5 times the additional number of hands you need to wield or hold all the items you are holding (for example, to hold 3 daggers would be a DC 5, while to hold 3 daggers and greatsword would be DC 15). On failure, you drop any that you don’t have sufficient hands to hold.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 3rd level, when you fail an ability check or attack roll, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to pass it off as an intentional failure, recovering in spectacular fashion. When you do so, reroll the check or attack roll and add your Bardic Inspiration to the result.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, your acrobatic mastery gives you proficiency in Acrobatics (or another skill of your choice if you already proficient in it). You can use your acrobatic foolery to tumble around the most dangerous places safely. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acrobatic Movement.</strong> You gain a climbing speed of 20 feet, and falls of 20 feet or less deal no damage to you. Whenever you fall, you can choose to land on your feet (rather than fall prone).</li>
                <li><strong>Tumble.</strong> As a bonus action, you can leap and tumble, spending up to 10 feet of movement while ignoring difficult terrain, not provoking opportunity attacks, and moving through creatures’ spaces (including hostile creatures).</li>
                <li><strong>Balance.</strong> You gain advantage on saving throws and ability checks made to avoid falling or being knocked prone.</li>

            <p>Starting at 14th level, you can build off the success of others and encourage them to greater heights. When another creature scores a critical hit while within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack against the same target.</p>
