        <description>
            <p>Druids are often thought of as the guardians of the natural order and having a deep connection to the creatures of the land. Sometimes that connection goes horribly wrong. A druid of this circle has found their mind entangled with the horrors of the beyond, their natural connection to nature and its beasts becoming warped by the dark dreams.</p>
            <p class="indent">Druids of this circle may be haunted by the terrors they see, but many simply find their minds inoculated against the horror (perhaps by the touch of madness). Some even treat twisted abominations with the same care other druids might take to vicious and wild animals, treating them with pragmatic understanding and empathy.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sometimes their connection even seems to be mutual.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level, you learn the message cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Nightmares Spells table. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>
