            <p>Rooted in the ancient growth of the world, these Wardens are linked to a primordial untamed aspect of the world. Their vines lash and bind, inexorably dragging their enemies to the conclusion of their place in the natural cycle of life and death.</p>

If a creature more than 5 feet away from you is grappled or restrained by you with this weapon their movement is not reduced to zero, but they can only move toward you.

                <li><strong>Grappling Larger Creatures.</strong> You can attempt to grapple creatures up to two sizes larger than you when initiating a grapple with this weapon, but creatures two sizes larger than you have their movement speed reduced by half, rather than reduced to zero. If they move out of range of your grapple, you can choose to release them, or be pulled along with their movement.</li>
