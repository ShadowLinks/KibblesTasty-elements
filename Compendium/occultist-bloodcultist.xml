        <description>
            <p>The dark tradition of a Blood Cultist is one that seeks power at any cost. They are those prepared to give up everything for power, dedicated themselves to mysterious rituals, forbidden techniques, and whispered taboos in order to grasp hold of ancient and terrible powers. Masters of sacrifice, blood magic, and willing to cast aside their humanity (or relevant equivalent!), they are driven beyond what most would consider rational, natural, or even possible on their eternal quest to go beyond the limiting walls of mortality to find new dark powers.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the Hemomancer feat, granting you the included ability to cast Blood Magic spells with your hit points (detailed in the feat).</p>
            <p><strong>Feat: Hemomancer</strong></p>
            <p class="indent">You can sacrifice your essence to cast spells with the "(blood magic)" tag in place of expending a spell slot. To do so, sacrifice 5 hit points per level of the spell. These hit points sacrificed can count towards the hit point cost of the blood Material component of the spell. You can cast a total number of spell levels in this manner equal to your character level, but casting a spell of 6th level or higher this way drains your vitality in a more profound way, causing you to gain levels of exhaustion equal to the number of levels over 5th the spell is (1 level for a 6th-level spell, 2 for a 7th-level spell, etc.). You cannot cast spells over 5th level this way while you have any levels of exhaustion. The total number of spell levels you can cast in this manner resets when you take a long rest.</p>
