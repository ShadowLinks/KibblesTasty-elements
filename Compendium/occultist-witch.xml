        <description>
            <p>A Witch can be many things, and most often refers to someone that villagers find scary and weird, but at the heart of every crazed story there’s a sliver of truth. That truth is that Witches do indeed exist.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some may openly live as they are, while others may be the last person the superstitious villagers would expect. Varied in their powers, designs, and traditions based on their Coven, generalizing about a Witch is challenging. They are most often defined by the varied and utilitarian magic they use, hexes that make crossing them unwise, and powerful intelligent familiars.</p>

            <p>As you delve into your Tradition of occult magic, you find deviations and branches to explore that help you specialize and perfect your craft in the way that best suits you.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 2nd Level, you gain two occult rites of your choice. Your occult rites options are detailed at the end of the occult tradition description for tradition specific Rites, and at the end of the class description for general rites. You can select from either your tradition or class list. When you gain certain Occultist levels, you gain additional occult rites of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the occult rites you know and replace it with another occult rite that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in an occult rite refers to Occultist level, not character level.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you select the Coven you belong to from among the Black Coven, the White Coven, or the Green Coven. Based on which Coven you select, you gain access to additional spells and manifest different special powers. Spells gained from this feature are added to your spells known and count as Occultist spells for you, but do not count against the total number of spells you can know.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the Covens are often associated with Evil, Good, and Neutral respectively, you do not have to have a particular alignment to join a particular coven — it is merely your area of expertise and what traditions you know.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each Coven explores a different expression of magic. A Witch of the Black Coven specializes in inflicting pain, curses, and eventual agonizing death on those that cross them. By contrast, a Witch of the White Coven focuses on binding and healing. The focus of a Witch of the Green Coven is the closest to the Witch’s roots in hag-like fey magic, drawing power from nature to baffle her foes and control her surroundings.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Red Coven</em></strong> As a reaction to an allied creature taking damage while within 5 feet of your familiar, you can transfer up to four times your Occultist level of that damage (up to 12 at level 3 when you get this feature) to another willing creature within 60 feet of it. The damage transferred cannot exceed the current hit points of the target of the transfer.

            <p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you cast a spell with a range of touch (including through your familiar), you can add one of the following modifiers to the spell:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temporary Hit Points.</strong> It grants one affected target temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. Only one creature can have these temporary hit points at a time.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonus Damage.</strong> It deals additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier to one affected creature.</li>
                <li><strong>Misfortune.</strong> It adds or subtracts 1d4 from the target’s next attack roll or saving throw before the start of your next turn.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You can also confer these effects to another spell with a range longer than touch by making its range touch. If you make the range of a curse spell touch, you no longer need the material component for the spell.</p>
