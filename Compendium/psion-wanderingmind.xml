        <description>
            <p>A Wandering Mind is among the more mysterious incarnates of psions, these are individuals that just aren’t quite rooted in the same reality everyone else is... they find it more pliable and slippery, and prone to jumping right through it on occasion.</p>
            <p class="indent">How they get their powers varies. Some were born in the ethereal plane or went through a portal while young. Sometimes it is just that their mind just works along an axis most people cannot understand. No matter its source, they manifest a truly unique ability to treat certain aspects of the metaphysical with a certain mundanity, and are prone to treating their powers as absolutely natural things as one might treat an arm or leg.</p>

            <p>At 1st level when you select this archetype, your mind grows a greater perspective on the nature of space and dimensions, allowing you to manipulate it and your relation to it, granting you the psionic discipline of Transposition</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, your connection to your transdimensional powers are such that you can slide through the spaces you see in dimensions as another might slip through a tight space, without conscious thought or effort. You can use your Dexterity ability score in place of your Intelligence ability score calculating the DC or attack roll modifier of Transpositional powers, alternate effects, or talents that require the Transpositional discipline.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, your wandering mind adapts to new situations constantly. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can select two skills you lack proficiency in. Until the end of your next long rest, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to ability checks made with those skills.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 14th level, your understanding of how to traverse space expands to a previously incomprehensible scale. You gain the ability to cast plane shift and teleport. You can cast one of these spells per day once without expending a spell slot or use of Innate Psionics. Once you do this, you must finish a long rest before you can use them again, or use your 7th level or higher use of Innate Psionics instead of the spell selected for that level to cast these spells again before finishing a long rest. If you already have one of these spells selected for your 7th level Innate psionic power, you can select a new 7th-level spell from the psion list for that slot. Material components are still required for casting plane shift this way.</p>
