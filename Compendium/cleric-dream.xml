            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to pull a creatureâ€™s mind into dreaming trance.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you present your holy symbol and choose a creature within 60 feet, attempting to pull their mind into the dreamscape for up to 10 minutes. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, preventing the effect on a successful save. If they fail and become ensnared, they can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns, escaping the trance on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">While their mind is in the dreamscape, the creature is incapacitated, blinded, and deafened to the real world.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can guide the dreams of an affected creature, ending the effect and causing one of the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Terrifying Visions.</strong> The creature takes psychic damage equal to 4 times your Cleric level and becomes frightened of you until the start of your next turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Tranquil Visions.</strong> Any charmed or frightened condition on the creature is ended, and they gain temporary hit points equal to 4 times your cleric level, waking at the end of their next turn.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Creatures that are already asleep automatically fail their initial saving throw against this effect. A creature that takes damage is broken out of their dream trance, ending the effect. A creature that cannot be charmed automatically passes their saving throw against this ability.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, as an action you can manifest parts of your dreams into the real world as fleeting creations within a 20-foot cube within 30 feet of you. You can create an object (such as a chair or bed), structure (such as a small empty house, a bridge, or stairs), or creature this way, but whatever is created must fit within a 20-foot cube. Creatures created this way are illusionary, behaving as per the major image spell, but objects and effects can be made real with the following limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Magical Nature.</strong> Objects and structures created this way are obviously magical in nature and crumble to nothing after 1 minute.</li>
                <li><strong>Unreal.</strong> They have no value, and cannot be moved outside of the 20-foot cube they were made in.</li>
                <li><strong>No Information.</strong> They cannot contain any information you donâ€™t yourself know (for example a book on a subject you donâ€™t know would be blank).</li>
                <li><strong>Durability.</strong> Objects created this way have an AC equal to your Cleric level and crumble to dust if they take any damage. They cannot deal any damage, crumbling to dust if they would deal damage.</li>
