        <description>
            <p>Warlords are force multipliers for their companions. Some may be fearsome combatants, while others may never lift a weapon, but in either case their presence on the battlefield will drive their allies to new heights, guiding them safely through what would surely have been their doom.</p>
            <p class="indent">How victory is stolen from the jaws of defeat can vary, from inciting crazed zeal, to tempering an overeager charge, to pulling their friends out of the line of danger in the nick of time. The sole commonality is that a Warlord alone is but a man, while a Warlord with their companions is a legend.</p>
            <h4>Purpose and Drive</h4>
            <p>Purpose is a common element to those that walk the path of a Warlord. Purpose empowers Warlords to be a larger-than-life, and allows them to be a guiding hand to their comrades. Some Warlords may not seek any particular cause, and merely pursue victory— a god they worship or simply to attain personal glory. More often, though, a Warlord is driven by a higher purpose—a loyalty to their country or their men, a drive to protect the innocent or crush the weak.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>Power of Presence</h4>
            <p>Most warlords have no explicitly magical powers, but the presence on the battlefield allows people to exceed what they might have thought of as their own limits, pushing beyond what they could hope to achieve on their own. A Warlord will make their allies feel like they’ve become better at everything, they will make problems seem surmountable, and they will make the path clear. They make the world less bleak, they make the foes less terrifying. When you have a Warlord on your side, more things go right.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>CREATING A WARLORD</h4>
            <p>When creating a Warlord you should always start with answering the question: what sort of Presence does this person bring to the battlefield? Are they a charismatic inspiration to their allies that drives them to fight on? Are they a wise veteran who acts as a force multiplier for their companions, offering pointers and grit? Or are they a scheming manipulator who sees one step ahead of any move their foes can make, always making sure their allies are in the right spot?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a warlord quickly by following these suggestions. For a Commander, select Strength as your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. For a Chieftain or Paragon, select Strength as your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. For a Noble, select Charisma as your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. For a Packleader, select Dexterity as your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. For a Tactician, select Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.</p>

            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you have access to Leadership Dice. These represent your ability to focus your battlefield presence for powerful results. Your Warlord level determines the number and size of the dice, as shown on the Leadership Dice column of the Warlord table. You can spend these to fuel various features.</p>
            <p class="indent">You know three such features: Rallying Mark, Urgent Orders, and Helpful Word. When you get this feature, you can spend one Leadership Die per turn. Starting at 6th level, you can spend two Leadership Dice per turn. The number you can expend increases to three at 11th level, and to four at 17th level.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Leadership Die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended Leadership Dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

            <p><strong>Helpful Word</strong></p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can spend a Leadership Die to take the Help action. When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if your ally can see or hear you.</p>

            <description level="9">As a bonus action, you can spend a Leadership Die to take the Help action. When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if your ally can see or hear you.
            When a creature benefits from your Help action, you can use your reaction to expend a Leadership Die and add it to their roll. You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.</description>
