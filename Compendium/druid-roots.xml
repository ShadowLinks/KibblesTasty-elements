        <description>
            <p>While many druids have a kinship with the deep woods of nature, a Circle of Roots druid has a connection that can go much deeper, where some may wonder where the will of the primordial woods ends and the will of the druid starts. Legends say that the first of these druids were woads who took human form, rather than humans that took woad form, but such things are lost to legend.</p>
            <p class="indent">Frequently, regardless of the nature of their connection, these druids will feel most comfortable deep in nature, and place great value in its unspoiled form, sharing a world view more in common with dryads and treants than other mortals... perhaps they were even raised by such creatures, leading them to this path.</p>
            <p class="indent">Members of this Circle stray toward what many would consider Neutral, not commonly becoming embroiled by mortal causes except where they overlap with their own concerns.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level, you learn the shillelagh cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Roots Spells table. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>

            <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain an alternate use for Wild Shape. As a bonus action, you assume a treelike form, covered in leaves and bark, which lasts up to one hour, or until you end it as a bonus action or until you are incapacitated. You gain the following properties when you transform:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Large Sized.</strong> You can make yourself Large sized. If you do so, your reach becomes 10 feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Grappling Roots.</strong> You can make a Wisdom (Athletics) check to initiate, maintain, or contest a grapple, and have a number of grappling appendages (in the form of grasping roots or branches) equal to your Wisdom modifier.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Weapons.</strong> Each appendage serves as a natural weapon under the effect of shillelagh. While in this form, you can cast shillelagh on any weapon you are carrying.</li>
                <li><strong>Durable Bark.</strong> Your AC is 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Wisdom modifier. You cannot benefit from the AC of armor or shields while in this form.</li>
                <li><strong>Temporary Hit Points.</strong> You gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + twice your Druid level when you transform into tree form. When the form ends, you lose any temporary hit points you have from it.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforced Form.</strong> When you take this form, you can expend a 1st level or higher spell slot. When you do so, the temporary hit points you gain increases by 1d8 per level of the spell slot spent.</li>
                <li><strong>Ponderous Movement.</strong> Any speed you have becomes 15 feet, unless the speed was lower. If you don’t move during your turn, you have advantage on Ability Checks and Saving Throws against effects that would move you or knock you prone.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment. Your equipment doesn’t change to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. You can cast spells as normal while in this form.</p>
