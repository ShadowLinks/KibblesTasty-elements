        <description>
            <p>Starting at 9th level, you have mastered one technique of your choice for approaching a target. Select one of the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>False Face.</strong> You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the disguise kit, and can assume a prepared disguise with the bonus action granted by Cunning Action.</li>
                <li><strong>Blade in the Dark.</strong> You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the Stealth skill. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by dim light.</li>
                <li><strong>Poisoner’s Path.</strong> You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the poisoner’s kit. During a long rest, you can create a long lasting poison for one or more weapons for free. Until the end of your next long rest your Sneak Attack damage with that weapon becomes Poison damage and creatures struck with it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier or become Poisoned for one minute. Creatures poisoned this way make a new save at the end of each of their turns, ending the condition on success. Once a creature passes the save against this effect, it cannot suffer the Poisoned condition from it again for 24 hours.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">If you gain expertise in a skill you already have expertise in, you can instead select another skill or tool you have proficiency in to gain expertise in.</p>
