            <p>A shaman is an Occultist that walks the paths of the spirits, binding them to their cause to empower themselves or bring havoc to their foes. Tough and powerful, they are most often found in the thick of the fight, wreathed in their primal power.</p>
            <p class="indent">A shaman may view themselves as in service to their spirits or as served by the spirits; the what and the how of their contract can vary wildly, as can the source of their spirits, be it pulling from ancestral or primal powers.</p>

            <p>As you delve into your Tradition of occult magic, you find deviations and branches to explore that help you specialize and perfect your craft in the way that best suits you.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 2nd Level, you gain two occult rites of your choice. Your occult rites options are detailed at the end of the occult tradition description for tradition specific Rites, and at the end of the class description for general rites. You can select from either your tradition or class list. When you gain certain Occultist levels, you gain additional occult rites of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the occult rites you know and replace it with another occult rite that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in an occult rite refers to Occultist level, not character level.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action you can call a spirit to your side. This can be a primal spirit of fire, cold, or lightning, or an ancestral spirit with radiant or necrotic power. This bond lasts for 10 minutes once formed. You can release a spirit early as an action, and it is immediately released if you call another spirit.</p>
            <p class="indent">While a spirit is bonded to you, your melee weapon attacks deal an additional 1d4 damage of the spirit’s type.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you call it or as a bonus action while it is bonded, you can manifest the spirit in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The spirit is medium sized but spectral in nature while manifested. While the spirit is manifested, whenever you take the attack action you may replace any number of attacks you could normally take with melee spell attacks from your bonded spirit. On a hit, this melee spell attack deals 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier damage of the spirit’s type. As a bonus action you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction or recall it to yourself, ending its manifestation.</p>
            <p class="indent">A manifested spirit cannot move more than 60 feet from you, and is recalled to you if you are ever more than 60 feet from it.</p>
