        <description>
            <p>Psions are those who have tapped into a special otherworldly force, with the ability to actualize the power of their mind to accomplish impossible feats. Reading minds, lifting vast weights, and transcending physical limitations, they tend to inspire awe and terror in equal measure.</p>
            <p class="indent">The exact nature of what psionic power is might be a question answered in your setting, or it might not be. Most view psionic power as coming from within, though other answers exist—anything from the leaking power of the realms beyond, to an alternate way to express magic, to an actualization of an individual’s will upon the world.</p>
            <h4>Powerful Minds</h4>
            <p>Since a psion’s weapon is their mind, they are always a careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep their thoughts and emotions in check, lest their powers run amok. This leads to many of them developing odd behaviors or mannerisms to help them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric to an outside observer.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider how your psion keeps their powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday life. How reading minds may affect their body language or habits. Do they add wood to the campfire from the comfort of their bedroll, or do they restrain themselves from using their power for trivial matters lest they slip up?</p>
            <h4>Misunderstood Powers</h4>
            <p>In a world of widespread magic, many will assume a psion to be a type of Sorcerer or Wizard, mistaking their powers for the common applications of magic. The common villager keeps only one mental category for the supernatural and creepy people that bend reality to their will. But even among magic users, a psion’s powers will frequently be found unnerving.</p>
            <p class="indent">It is often those who do understand magic that find a psion’s abilities the most aberrant. A force that intersects the magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A PSION</h4>
            <p>When creating a psion, consider your character’s background. How did you become a psion? Were you born with latent powers? Or did something happen to you granting your powers? Or did you intentionally train yourself through rigorous mental exercise to leverage them? Consider how developing a rare and mysterious power would have affected your interactions with people.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider what your purpose is with your newfound powers, or how you plan to use your powers. Do you intend to be taken for a Wizard casting magic, or are you freely open about being of a... different nature?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a psion quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose a background that lends itself to intelligence skills.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <p>At 1st level, you pick the archetype of psion you embody, choosing from Awakened Mind, Unleashed Mind, Transcended Mind, Shaper’s Mind, Wandering Mind, Elemental Mind or Consuming Mind, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>

            <h5>Psionic Disciplines</h5>
            <p>You are granted access to a psionic discipline (such as Telepathy or Telekinesis) by your chosen archetype. A psionic discipline comes with a passive feature that expands your character’s capabilities and an active psionic power that can be modified and empowered with psi points. Additionally you can use your discipline in more detailed applications to recreate the effect of certain spells, listed at the end of the discipline description. At 3rd level you can select a second discipline, and 18th level you can select a 3rd discipline.</p>
            <p class="indent">Psionic powers are suppressed by antimagic fields and can be dispelled with dispel magic, but are only affected by counterspell if recreating the effect of a spell. Any check required to dispel magic, counterspell or to identify a spell being cast with psionics is made with disadvantage unless the caster also has the Psionics feature. The detect magic spell will detect the usage of psionics, but not their nature: it will show up as a mysterious untyped power, even if being used to generate the effect of a spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">When recreating a spell through a psionic effect (using a psionic discipline to cast the spell) the spell has no material or verbal components, but using any psionic ability requires somatic components and causes the psion to vibrantly glow with the otherworldly psionic energies they are controlling.</p>
            <h5>Psi Points</h5>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain access to psi points used to fuel psionic discipline powers and effects. You have a number of psi points equal to your psion level, and you regain all spent points when you finish a short or long rest. You can spend a number of psi points equal to half your Psion level (rounded up) at a time. For example, if you’re a 5th-level Psion, you can spend 3 psi points on a psionic power or cast a spell with a cost of 3 psi points.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You project an ethereal creation from your mind at a space you can see within range, taking the shape of a Medium or smaller creature, weapon, or other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack, so long as it doesn’t move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. If the Astral Construct moves out of range of the spell, it fades away into nothing, ending the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend psi points up to your per use limit to issue commands that affect and empower your construct. Commands require no action, but you can’t exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.</p>
            <p><strong>Grab</strong>(1 psi point): Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct that is no more than one size larger than the construct must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained by the construct. At the end of each of the restrained creature’s turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends if the construct becomes ethereal again, or becomes more than one size smaller than the target.</p>
            <p><strong>Grow</strong>(1 psi point): Your construct increases by one size, and its number of damage dice increases by one. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8).</p>
            <p><strong>Relocate</strong> (1 psi point): The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.</p>            
            <p><strong>Replicate</strong>(3 psi points): You use Relocate, but the original doesn’t disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another construct and control both with the same action (commands only affect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.</p>
            <p><strong>Solidify</strong>(1 psi point1): Your construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is in an unoccupied space. It has an armor class of 16 and hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your psion level. The construct becomes ethereal again if it drops to zero hit points.</p>
            <p><strong>Strike</strong>(2 psi points): The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).</p>
            <p><strong>Sustain</strong>(1+ psi points): At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command for an additional round. An effect that has been replicated can be sustained across all replicated constructs with a single use, but each effect can only be sustained once per turn (for example, you can never sustain more than one replicated construct). This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining Solidify refreshes the construct’s hit points to its maximum.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You can use your mind to create a burst of elemental power, blasting a target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">For each die of cold damage dealt, the creature’s speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. For each die of fire damage dealt by the original attack, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of its next turn. For each die of lightning damage dealt, an arc of lightning strikes another creature of your choice within 30 feet of the target, dealing 1d4 lightning damage (multiple arcs may strike the same creature). Damage from these secondary effects doesn’t add any bonuses (such as Empowered Psionics).</p>
            <p class="indent">You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.</p>
            <p><strong>Amplified</strong>(1+ psi point): The target takes an extra 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage on a hit for each additional point spent.</p>
            <p><strong>Lasting</strong>(1 psi point): Your Elemental Blast leaves a 5-foot-radius sphere of devastation behind where it strikes until the start of your next turn. Creatures that enter this zone for the first time or end their turn in it must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the secondary effects (slow, burn, arc) of the blast as if they had been hit by it.</p>
            <p><strong>Massive</strong> (1-3 psi points): You unleash a massive blast; rather than making an attack roll, all creatures within a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On failure, they take the effect as if hit by the Elemental Blast. The size of the cone is doubled for each point up to 3 spent (2 points for 30 feet, 3 points for 60 feet).</p>            
            <p><strong>Overcharged</strong>(0 psi point): You take 1d4 force damage and do not add your proficiency bonus from the attack or spell save DC for your Elemental Blast, but increase the damage it deals by twice your proficiency bonus.</p>

            <p class="indent">You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Denial modifying its functionality (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.</p>
            <p><strong>Aura of </strong>(3 psi points): Instead of targeting a creature, the power becomes an effect around you with a radius of 20 feet until the start of your next turn; any creature of your choice that enters or starts its turn in the area of effect must make a saving throw against the power.</p>
            <p><strong>Existential</strong>(1+ psi points): You deal an additional 1d4 initial and bonus (if applicable) force damage to the target creature on a failed save.</p>
            <p><strong>Firm</strong> (2 psi point): The target creature has disadvantage on the saving throw against this ability.</p>            
            <p><strong>Lingering</strong>(1+ psi points): You can apply the effect of Disruptive Touch to an affected creature.</p>
            <p><strong>Supernatural</strong> (1+ psi point): A supernatural effect of or on the creature is ended; if the effect is a magical or psionic power, it is only ended if the psi points spent on this modifier equals or exceeds the spell level or psi points spent on the effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the property is an innate property of a creature (either of the target creature, or affecting the target of this power), it is only ended if the psi points exceed the CR (or class levels) of the target creature, and they return at the end of that creature’s next turn. The supernatural effect can’t be its existence, unless it has less than 10 hit points and it would otherwise qualify.</p>

            <p>You assault the mind of a target you can see within range, rending and devouring its psionic energy. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage. If the target is frightened, charmed, stunned, restrained, grappled, or paralyzed, the psychic damage becomes 1d12 instead. On a failed save, you gain a psionic charge of consumed power until the end of your next turn. You can expend this charge when you deal damage to deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier, or consume this charge at the end of your turn to gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier.

            <p><strong>Rending</strong> (1+ psi points): The target takes an additional die of damage (1d6 or 1d12 as applicable if they are under the effect of a listed condition) per psi point spent on a failed save.</p>            
            <p><strong>Shredding</strong>(1 psi point): You leave the target’s mind and soul shredded, reducing their next saving throw before the end of your next turn by 1d4.</p>
            <p><strong>Stunning</strong> (3 psi points): On a failed saving throw, the target becomes stunned until the start of your next turn. If the power affects multiple targets, select one target for this effect.</p>
            <p><strong>Thieving</strong> (1 psi point): On a failed saving throw, you can draw a 5th level or lower spell the target can cast from its mind (from a Spellcasting or Psionics feature). You must be aware that it can cast that spell; the target retains the ability to cast the spell, but you gain the ability to cast the spell using your Psionics feature by spending psi points equal to the level of the spell (restricted by your psi point limit; you can’t use Psionic Mastery to cast this spell).</p>

            <p>As an action, you can spend 1 psi point to psionically see the aura of a creature of your choice within 30 feet. When you see the creature’s aura in this way, you can determine if there are any spells or magical effects affecting the creature, and you learn their schools of magic, if any. You can also determine if the creature is under the influence of psionics. A shapeshifter or creature that is transformed or disguised by magical or nonmagical means must make a Charisma (Deception) check against your Psionics save DC. On a failure, you can perceive their original form in their aura.</p>
