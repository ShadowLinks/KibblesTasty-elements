            <p>A Knowing Mind is a psion that grasps that future as intuitively as the present, weaving together strings of casualty and fate in ways that would shatter the mind of a lesser mortal. They live one step ahead and use that advantage to the fullest, bending probability, manipulating fate, and bringing their plans to fruition without room for failure.</p>
            <p class="indent">They are remarkable individuals whose clairvoyant abilities stem from a variety of sourcesâ€”from a lineage of divine oracles, to a connection to beings from another temporal axis, to a mind that has somehow been flung into the future.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, your ability to see and influence the future allows you to set things up to have even greater influence throughout the sequence of events, building up to a pivotal moment where exerting your foresight can provide the greatest impact.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once per turn when you use Seeing empowered by 1 or psi points to look into the future while in initiative (or under a similar high stakes situation), you gain an Influence point.
