            <p>You have made a pact with being of ancient knowledge. The actual nature of this being can vary greatly, it can be a Pact with a sentient library, an ancient spirit, or perhaps even a lost god of knowledge. This is a pact for a Warlock that seeks something beyond simple power: they seek knowledge—ancient and unknown knowledge that has once and will again exist.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can leverage this knowledge to know things that your mortal peers would consider miracles, delve the secrets that others do not even know exist, and (most importantly) perhaps even understand the philosophical mechanics of existence.</p>

            <p>When you select this Patron at 1st level, you can access the ancient secrets your patron has granted you. By expending a pact magic spell slot of at least one level higher than the spell you want to cast (or a 1st-level spell slot for a cantrip), you can cast an Abjuration, Divination, or Transmutation spell that does not appear on your spell list. This spell can be from any class’s spell list, but counts as a Warlock spell for you when you cast it this way. Spells cast this way are cast at one level lower than the spell slot used.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can do this a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier, and regain all uses of this feature at the end of a long rest.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 6th level, your understanding of the mechanics behind magical effects and the cosmic forces are developed enough that if you see a spell being cast, you can use your reaction to make an Arcana check to know what the spell is. If the spell you identify with this check would force you to make a saving throw, you can make that saving throw with advantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, your comprehension of magic allows you to access magic that is beyond your power, but not beyond your knowledge. You can cast from a Spell Scroll even if the spell isn’t on your spell list, and you can add your proficiency bonus to the ability check to successfully cast from a Spell Scroll.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 10th level, ancient knowledge has seeped so deeply into you, you instinctively draw from the ancient knowledge of your Patron. You gain the eldritch invocation Eyes of the Rune Keeper and it does not count against your Invocations Known. If you already have this invocation, you can select either Beast Speech or Eldritch Sight instead.</p>
