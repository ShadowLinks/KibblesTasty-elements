        <description>
            <p>For some druids, they have found their friends among the beasts of the wild, forming a close kinship with the furred and the fanged. They often roam the wilderness, placing little value on the trappings of civilization, more concerned with nature, hunting, and exploring.</p>
            <p class="indent">The longer they spend in the wild with their animal friends, the more their habits tend to intertwine with the beasts around them. Sometimes they will cook food for their animal friends, while other times they will take to eating their food raw. They play the role of a caretaker, warden, and advocate for the wild.</p>

            <p>Starting at 2nd level when you join this circle, you form a bond with a beast spirit and can allow it to take form by expending a use of your Wild Shape as an action. Its statblock becomes that of your Beast Companion, applying the modifications from the customization table that best fit the form it takes. At the GM’s discretion, custom abilities can replace those powers to better represent the beast companion. Once selected, the traits cannot be changed, as the beast’s spirit takes on that form permanently.</p>
            <p class="indent">The beast’s soul becomes entangled with your own, granting you the ability to call it forth from wherever it is, and even return it to life should it ever fall, by expending a use of your Wild Shape ability. As an action you can expend a use of Wild Shape to call it to an empty space within 10 feet of you, where it appears at full hit points and free of any conditions or spells that were affecting it. You can cause it to return to its spirit form as a bonus action, but must expend a use of Wild Shape to call it forth once more after doing so.</p>
            <p class="indent">In combat, the Beast Companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. You can command your Beast Companion as part of the same bonus action used to summon it. That action can be the one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the Beast Companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you manifest the companion, it lasts until you complete a long rest (unless you expend a use of Wild Shape to keep it manifested until a subsequent long rest), it is reduced to zero hit points, or you die, at which point it vanishes, fading away until you expend a use of Wild Shape to call it forth again.</p>
