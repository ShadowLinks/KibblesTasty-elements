            <p>You have made a pact with an all seeing being of the outer planes: an infamous creature whose very name is forbidden from being put to text by almighty coastal wizards, most known for its all seeing eyes, great paranoia, and reality warping dreams. The nature of your pact may be down to madness (yours, its, or both), or working toward some greater scheme of such brilliance that lesser minds cannot hope to comprehend.</p>
