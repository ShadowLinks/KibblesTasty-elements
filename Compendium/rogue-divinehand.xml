            <p>Not all priests are clerics. Not all problems can be solved by prayer and preaching. Sometimes a more subtle touch is needed to steer the world as the faith dictates, and that is the role of a Divine Hand. A blade in the night that commits the lesser evil for the greater good, or a quick end to someone that sniffed too close to the cult of a dark god’s business; both could be the work of these divinely guided rogues.</p>
            <p class="indent">Good is not nice, evil is not stupid. Whatever the organization or god a Divine Hand serves, it is one that understands the practical nature of the world. Spying, stealing, extracting information, purging the heretics... they have many tasks before them, and complete them with a grim determination.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 3rd level, divine devotion grants you the ability to use certain divine magic.</p>
            <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
            <p>The Divine Hand table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h4>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h4>
            <p>You learn three spells of your choice from the cleric spell list. You gain additional spells known as listed on the Spells Known column of the cleric spell casting table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of your spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Your spell casting ability is Wisdom. The power of your spells comes from the depth of your faith. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for spells you can cast, and when you make an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

            <p>You gain proficiency with martial weapons. Additionally, at the end of a long rest, you can turn flasks of water into flasks of holy water through a special ritual.

            <p class="indent">You can throw or splash holy water using the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action. When you do so, you can add your proficiency to attacks made using holy water as an improvised weapon. Alternatively, you can use your Cunning Action to apply holy water to a weapon you are carrying. When you do so, your Sneak Attack damage becomes radiant damage for 1 minute.</p>
