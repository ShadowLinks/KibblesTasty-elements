When you die, your body and equipment crumble to ash, reforming after 1 hour within 5 feet of the item to which you bound your soul. Once you revive in this way, you can’t revive in this way again for 1d10 days. After the first time you have revived, your creature type becomes undead (if it was not already). The item ceases to work if you have not slain a creature in the last 10 days. The item has 25 hit points and an AC of 10. When you bind your soul to it, the item gains immunity to all damage types beside one, to which it gains vulnerability. You select this damage type when you create it.</p>

            <description>You bind your soul to an item. When you die, your body and equipment crumble to ash, reforming after 1 hour within 5 feet of the item to which you bound your soul. Once you revive in this way, you can’t revive in this way again for 1d10 days. After the first time you have revived, your creature type becomes undead (if it was not already). The item ceases to work if you have not slain a creature in the last 10 days. The item has 25 hit points and an AC of 10. When you bind your soul to it, the item gains immunity to all damage types beside one, to which it gains vulnerability. You select this damage type when you create it.</description>

For each psi point spent you can bring a 5-foot-cube section of the illusion into reality until the start of your next turn, and it can have the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the effect would do damage, each 5-foot cube can damage one target. That target must pass a Dexterity saving throw, or take damage equal to a number of d8 dice equal to the level of the spell.</li>
                <li>If the effect would stop a creature, they can’t move through it. If the effect would restrain a creature, that creature must pass a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the start of your next turn.</li>
                <li>Each 5-foot cube can affect only one creature that is either within it or adjacent to it. The GM may allow other effects at their discretion.</li>
            </ul>
