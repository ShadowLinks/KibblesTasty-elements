        <description>
            <p>A potionsmith is an inventor who has pursued the secrets of alchemy. While many a village has an apothecary grinding odd herbs and roots into potent (or not so potent) concoctions, the careful process of mixing and brewing is just one way to achieve results. Through the use of the intricate secrets of the craft and direct infusions using magical rituals, a potionsmith can come up with explosive results in the blink of an eye... sometimes literally.</p>
            <p class="indent">A potionsmith can be a scholar who has delved into the knowledge the world has to offer or an explorer that has unlocked the secrets of the wilderness. Their knowledge could come from being friends of the fey or from unfettered access to the royal library. As such, potionsmith’s can be good or evil, lawful or chaotic.</p>

            <p>When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with blowguns, alchemist’s supplies, and the herbalism kit.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your knowledge of alchemy gives you a natural affinity for brewing potions. Creating a potion through normal crafting takes you only half the time it would normally take.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, you’ve acquired a pouch of useful basic reagents, much as a wizard might carry a component pouch. You’ve tucked away things that will come in handy, and can retrieve them as part of using an ability that might require them. As long as you have this pouch on you, you can use the potionsmith’s features. This pouch is considered to be alchemist’s supplies for the purposes of crafting.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose your reagent pouch, you can spend 50 gp to reacquire the various stocks you need, or spend 1 full day gathering them from a natural environment without expense.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you have discovered the secrets to drastically bypass the alchemical brewing process, crafting potent magical effects through the direct infusion of the potion with your own magic. When you finish a short or long rest, you can create any number of potions, choosing one of the following spells for each potion and expending a spell slot as if you were casting the spell. You must provide an empty vial for each potion you create in this way.</p>

The area of effect takes place when the vial is broken, with the effect centered on where the vial breaks.

            <p>You delve into the darkest, most mysterious depths of herbal lore, learning the potent secrets of poison. You gain proficiency with poisoner’s kits; if you already have this proficiency, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using a poisoner’s kit. Additionally, during a long rest, you can create one of the following poisons of your choice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Contact Poison.</em> You can apply this poison to a melee weapon or up to ten pieces of ammunition. That weapon or ammunition deals an extra 1d4 poison damage on a hit; the weapon can deal this poison damage 10 times before the poison wears off.</li>
                <li><em>Injested Poison.</em> This poison is a simple, flavorless powder. If a creature consumes a full dose of the poison, it must make a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage against your spell save DC. After 1 minute, if the creature failed its saving throw, it takes 1d10 poison damage per level you have in this class, and it becomes poisoned until it finishes a long rest.</li>
                <li><em>Inhaled Poison.</em> You can use this dose of poison to increase the size and potency of your Poisonous Gas instant reaction. When you do so, the fumes erupt in a 20-foot-radius sphere and the effect’s damage dice are doubled.</li>
