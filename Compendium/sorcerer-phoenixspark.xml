            <p>Some say the flames of a phoenix are the origin of all of life, and these sparks are fragments of some primordial origin. Many dismiss such mythological sources, explaining that these sparks are ancient blessings: motes of power caught within the soul, remnants of some ancestor being healed by powers of a phoenix.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whatever their origin, they grant a powerful duality of life and destruction in equal measure, flames that cauterize the world.</p>

            <p>You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Phoenix Origin Spells list. For each level of spells, you can select one of the two spells to learn. You learn the selected spell and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known.</p>

            <p>When you choose this origin at 1st level, a spark ignites within you. As a bonus action, you can rekindle that spark, burning until the start of your next turn. You regain 1d6 hit points, and gain the following benefits while the spark is burning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wings of Flame.</strong> You form immaterial wings for fire, allowing you to use your Charisma to calculate jumping distance instead of your Strength, and reducing any fall damage you take by your Charisma ability score. If you reduce fall damage to 0, you don’t fall prone. These wings shed bright light for 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Phoenix Fire.</strong> When you roll to deal fire damage or restore hit points with a spell you cast, you can add your Charisma modifier to one roll.</li>
                <li><strong>Fire Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to fire damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you complete a long rest. While you have no uses remaining, you can use one sorcery point to activate this ability instead of a use of the feature.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals fire damage to creatures that you can see, you can expend one sorcery point per creature to protect creatures of your choice that would be affected from the flames. The chosen creatures automatically succeed any saving throws against the spell, and instead of taking fire damage, they regain hit points equal to half the fire damage they would have taken from the spell a failed save or hit.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>

            <p>Starting at 14th level, when you activate a Phoenix Spark you can expend a second use of the feature (or one sorcery point) to enhance the power of the spark for that activation. When you do so it lasts for 1 minute. Additionally, the spark intensifies, giving you the additional effects for the duration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong></strong>Wings of Fire. Your immaterial wings of fire solidify, and you gain a flying speed of 30 feet during the duration of the spark.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Regeneration. You regain 1d6 hit points at the start of each of your turns while under the effect.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Flaming Aura. If a creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to burn them with the flames, dealing 2d6 fire damage to them.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Shed Light. You shed bright light in a 20 foot radius, and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</li>

            <p>At 18th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, or as an action at any time, you can explode into fire, dealing 8d6 fire damage to all creatures within a 30 foot radius of you and being temporarily reborn as a phoenix. You can apply Rejuvenating Flames to this fire damage as though it were a spell and without expending a use of the feature or sorcery points.</p>
            <p class="indent">You assume the form of a fire elemental as if by the shapechange spell. This form has the following modification: you gain a flying speed of 60 feet, gain the Flyby feature (meaning your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity when you fly out of an enemy’s reach), you add your Charisma modifier (minimum +1) to all attack and damage rolls with your Touch attack, and can understand and speak any languages you can normally speak. It does not require concentration, and you cannot change your form as an action. You return to your normal form after 1 hour, or you can end the effect early as an action.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you have assumed this form, you cannot assume it again until you complete a long rest</p>
