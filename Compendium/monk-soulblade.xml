            <p>Monks of the Way of the Soul Blade are monks who have learned to harness and focus their ki, using their inner will and focus to control psionic powers—primarily into a blade of pure psionic power: a Soul Blade.</p>

            <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you’ve learned to focus your ki into a psionic blade. As a bonus action, you can create a blade of pure scintillating psionic energy. The blade you create this way most typically takes the form of a knife-like blade projecting from your fist, but you can shape it however you choose. You can choose to create multiple blades, but any blade you are not touching vanishes at the end of your turn and must be resummoned.</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless of the form it takes, the weapon is a monk weapon for you, deals 1d8 psychic damage, and has the light, finesse, and thrown(20/60) properties.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you gain the Telekinetics Discipline; this can be found under the Psionic Disciplines list of the psion class. You can use ki points as psi points, with a limit of 1 ki point. This limit increases to 2 ki points at level 5, 3 ki points at level 9, 4 ki points at level 13, and 5 ki points at level 17. The DC for your psionic abilities is equal to your ki save DC.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your character has both psi points and ki points, those are added together into one pool and can be used interchangeably. Your psi limit (and the limit you can use ki points as psi points) becomes your psi limit + one third of your monk levels rounded down.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use your action on a psionic power or to cast a spell using this feature, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of your turn.</p>
