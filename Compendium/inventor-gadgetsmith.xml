        <description>
            <p>A gadgetsmith is an inventor whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other inventors may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a gadgetsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.</p>
            <p class="indent">Quick footed and even quicker witted, gadgetsmiths are never caught without another trick up their sleeve—their minds always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever contraption.</p>
            <p class="indent">A gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but they usually exemplify curiosity and a distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment and leaning toward more chaotic behaviors.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, you’ve mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You have the following items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Gadgetsmith Weapons</em> Choose one of the following from the Upgrade section: Impact Gauntlets, Lightning Baton, Repeating Hand Crossbow, Ricocheting Weapon, or Shock Generator. You gain the chosen upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your total number of upgrades.</li>
                <li><em>Grappling Hook </em>You can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to throw your grappling hook at a target within 20 feet of you. The target can be a creature, object, or surface. If the target is Small or smaller, make a grapple check against it, pulling it to you and grappling it on a success. If the target is Medium or larger, you can instead pull yourself to it (no check required); this doesn’t grapple the target. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.</li>
                <li><em>Smoke Bomb </em>As an action, you can use a smoke bomb to cast the fog cloud spell centered on yourself, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesn’t require your concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can choose for it to have a radius of 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.</li>

Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (target’s choice). A creature that is immune to being grappled or restrained automatically succeeds on this check. If you succeed, the target is shackled to you or the nearby object, and it can only move if it’s able to move what it’s shackled to.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, while shackled in this way, the target can’t teleport, travel to another plane of existence, alter its form (such as by the polymorph spell), or dematerialize. As anaction, the target can make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, breaking the shackles on a success; otherwise, the shackles last until you remove them.</p>

            <p>You design a type of tiny, firecracker-like device, which can release rockets in large numbers. You have a maximum number of rockets equal to your inventor level. As an action, you can release between 1 and 10 rockets. Each rocket targets a point you can see within 40 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of one of these points must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures in the area of effect of multiple rockets make a separate saving throw for each rocket. For each failed save, a creature takes 2d6 + 1 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

As an action, you can reach into the toolbox and withdraw an Unrestricted Upgrade of your choice (one with no level requirement) from the Gadgetsmith list. Gadgets withdrawn from the toolbox are fleeting, and disappear after 1 minute. Once you have withdrawn an upgrade from the toolbox, you can’t withdraw another upgrade from it until you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p>You create a floating metal sphere, that when activated spews a storm of metal shards in all directions around it. As an action you can deploy a small construct (see the construct’s statistics below), throwing it up to 30 feet where it will hover in place.
