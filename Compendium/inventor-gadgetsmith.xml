        <description>
            <p>A gadgetsmith is an inventor whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other inventors may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a gadgetsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.</p>
            <p class="indent">Quick footed and even quicker witted, gadgetsmiths are never caught without another trick up their sleeve—their minds always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever contraption.</p>
            <p class="indent">A gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but they usually exemplify curiosity and a distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment and leaning toward more chaotic behaviors.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, you’ve mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You have the following items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Gadgetsmith Weapons</em>Choose one of the following from the Upgrade section: Impact Gauntlets, Lightning Baton, Repeating Hand Crossbow, Ricocheting Weapon, or Shock Generator. You gain the chosen upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your total number of upgrades.</li>
                <li><em>Grappling Hook </em>You can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to throw your grappling hook at a target within 20 feet of you. The target can be a creature, object, or surface. If the target is Small or smaller, make a grapple check against it, pulling it to you and grappling it on a success. If the target is Medium or larger, you can instead pull yourself to it (no check required); this doesn’t grapple the target. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.</li>
                <li><em>Smoke Bomb </em>As an action, you can use a smoke bomb to cast the fog cloud spell centered on yourself, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesn’t require your concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can choose for it to have a radius of 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.</li>
