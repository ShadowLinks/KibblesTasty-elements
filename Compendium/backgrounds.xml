Hailing from the largest cities or the smallest villages, an apothecary’s work is always in demand, though many that would demand it do not fully appreciate the care that goes into making a potion safe and effective.</p>

            <p>Falling somewhere between a merchant, a sage, and—if you ask some villagers—a vagabond, a Tinker wanders from town to town bringing a cart (or sometimes just a donkey) of knickknacks and knowhow. While not always welcomed with open arms, they can be a lifeline to the smallest and most widely flung towns, as no route is too odd and winding for them to wander. Tinkers may be wanderers by nature, but what opens doors is their useful knack for being able to fix problems with a dash of knowhow and ingenuity.</p>
