            <p>Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, when you roll initiative or as a bonus action at any time, you can manifest an oversized melee weapon of pure force energy. This can take the shape of any bladed melee weapon, but it is a one-handed weapon that deals 1d10 force damage with a range of 5 feet regardless of its form.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you attack with this weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier (in place of your Strength) for attack and damage rolls. This weapon lasts until you let go of it, become incapacitated, or dismiss it as a bonus action.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this weapon is temporary and magical, it counts as having a value of 1 sp for purposes of being treated as a material component in spells.</p>

            <p>As a ritual taking 1 hour, you can absorb the power from a magical weapon with a bonus to attack and damage rolls. This cannot target artifacts, sentient weapons, or cursed items. At your DM’s discretion, this might not work with other weapons depending on their origin and type. This drains the power from the weapon, leaving it as a mundane weapon, but your Aethersword gains the bonus to attack and damage rolls previously possessed by the magical weapon.</p>

            <p>Starting at 20th level, you can overcharge your Aether Blade for 1 minute (no action required). For the duration, when you attack with your Aether Blade, you ignore all non-magical armor and defenses to treat the target’s AC as 10 + their Dexterity modifier for that attack (magical defenses like the mage armor or shield are not bypassed). While attacking in this way with your Aether Blade, your attacks can target up to 2 creatures as long as they are within 10 feet of each other, though if an attack triggers a spell through Spellstrike, it does not affect the second target unless the spell can target multiple creatures.</p>
