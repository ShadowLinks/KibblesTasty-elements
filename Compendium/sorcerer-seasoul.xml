            <p>The power of water is the strength of flexibility, resilience, and a relentless nature. Water parts to allow a ship to sail over it or a diver to plunge into it, but their passing leaves no mark. Water flowing down a mountain reaches the sea. It might bend and turn across valleys and down hillsides, but it slowly and steadily returns to the waves. Those whose souls are touched by the power of elemental water command a similar power.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your heritage ties back to powerful creatures of the sea, such as nereids, the lords of the merfolk, or elemental powers. Like a river, you feel the call of the ocean. The call is ever present in your heart, and you are never completely at peace until you are near the sea.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, your connection to waves and waters lets you bend them to your will. You learn the manipulate water cantrip, and it does not count against your spells known.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you cast a water or cold spell (a spell that controls water, deals water based bludgeoning damage, or deals cold damage) that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>
