        <description>
            <p>While Warlords may specialize in the control of battles, an Packleader is a Warlord that aims to win a fight before it becomes a battle. Through scouting, preparing, and stacking the odds, they don’t fight fair, they fight to win, and seek to only fight when they’ve already won.</p>
            <p class="indent">Their control of the battlefield doesn’t merely extend to those that fight on it, but to twisting the battlefield itself to suit their needs, stymieing and stupefying their foes while concealing and sheltering their allies with the terrain itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">While good and evil rarely play directly into a Packleader’s perspective (they can be either or Neutral just as easily), they tend be Chaotic, viewing the so called “rules of engagement” and other traditions of civilization to be convenient weaknesses they can exploit rather than any sort of guideline they might actually follow.</p>
