        <description>
            <p>While most clerics follow defined gods who seek to convert others to the cause, those of the Mystery Cults often intentionally obscure their faith with esoteric references and cloaked intentions. No less devoted than their more classically divine peers, they are not merely warlocks, but people of true faith in their dark and unknown deities.</p>
            <p class="indent">Standing at the blasphemous confluence of divine and psionic power, they are almost universally condemned and feared, often shrouding their nature and abilities with mystery and working toward esoteric goals.</p>
