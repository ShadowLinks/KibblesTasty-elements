            <p>As a Rimeblade, you blur the boundary between the arcane and the arctic, wielding your sword with the cold precision of an icicleâ€™s edge. Your enemies find no warmth nor respite, only the biting frost of your magic and blade.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whether born amidst the relentless snows of the far north or touched by the raw, freezing power of the elemental plane of ice, you have carved a path of icy resolve. Your frost-infused strikes echo the merciless advance of winter, freezing foes in their tracks and turning the battlefield into a glacial field of victory</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. That weapon is imbued with frost energy. You can change its damage to cold damage, and when you attack with that weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</p>

            <p>Starting at 20th level, you can release a blast of freezing energy that plunges an 30-foot radius centered on you into a state of everfrost for 1 minute (no action required). It has the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong></strong>Difficult Terrain. The area becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than you</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Cold Resistance. Allied creatures in the area gain resistance to cold damage, while hostile creatures lose any resistance than may have to cold damage.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Slowed. Creatures in the area when you use the ability become under the effect of the slow spell as they start to freeze. Creatures slowed in this way must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On success the effect ends. On failure, they become restrained while under the effect. Creatures automatically pass the save if they are outside of the area of effect. You can exclude a number of creatures from becoming slowed equal to your Intelligence modifier</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You can end the effect letting the area thaw earlier at any time on your turn. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
