        <description>
            <p>You focus your telepathic powers on a creature you can see within range and ask it a simple question. It must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or conjure a short thought or image that answers your question to the best of its ability. You perceive this response telepathically. If you cast this spell on the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period, it gains a cumulative +5 bonus to the save on every subsequent query after the first.</p>

        <description>
            <p>As an action, you create and enter an imaginary world, and pull all other creatures within 120 feet in with you. This world is centered on you, and extends in 120 feet in all directions. You leave a psionic rift in your place when you exit the real world.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that reaches the edge of this world and has at least 5 feet of movement remaining can make a Charisma saving throw to attempt to exit. On a success, it can move 5 feet to exit the world and return to its prior location. On a failure, it can't exit and can't try again until its next turn. A creature outside the world can attempt to enter it by moving to the location where you cast the spell and succeeding on a Charisma saving throw. You can choose to allow any creature to automatically succeed on a save to enter or exit the world.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you create this world, you can include any obstacles or terrain of your choice. These walls, pillars, or other obstacles can occupy up to twenty 5-square-foot areas, rising to any height. They can be placed in adjacent spaces or spread out as you wish, but every creature within the world must have open paths to reach both you and the world's edge.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can additionally create up to five hazardous spaces in 5-square-foot areas on the ground. These can take any form (e.g. fire, spikes), and deal 4d4 + 4 psychic damage to a creature when it enters the effect’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. Each hazard must be at least 20 feet from every other hazard.</p>
            <p class="indent">While in your inner world, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can do so up to 3 times over the spell's duration. Additionally, all your spells and psionic powers have their psi point costs reduced by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you can attempt to destroy a creature within the world. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 8d8 + 8 psychic damage and be forcibly ejected from the imaginary world, returning to its prior location in the real world.</p>
            <p class="indent">The world can be brightly or dimly lit, and you control the weather within it. You control the aesthetic features of the world and any terrain and hazards you create inside.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, you and any creatures remaining in the world exit and return to your prior locations in the real world.</p>
