            <p>A Tactician may very well tell you they would just as soon not be close enough to the battle to be considered a combatant, preferring to win their fights before they even reach that stage, but one would be a fool to underestimate how dangerous they are once on the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent">While they might have laid their plans in advance, their sharp minds can quickly pick apart how their foes try to fight against them and effortlessly pierce the crude tactics that would be used against them and their allies.</p>
            <p class="indent">What tends to mark a Tactician is a keen mind and a willingness to plan ahead... in great detail. Adventurers with a tactician among them are near impossible to pin down, as they will always find a way to turn the tables.</p>
