            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
                <li><strong>Skeleton Carving.</strong> You gain a natural weapon that deals 2d4 damage (piercing or slashing, your choice) or Increase your AC by 1. If you already have a natural weapon and select a natural weapon , you can increase the damage of your existing natural weapon by a d2 step instead (from a d6 to a d8, for example). If a natural weapon has multiple damage dice, increase only one this way.</li>

            This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Large or smaller creatures in your path must make a Strength saving throw, or be knocked out of your way and prone. If a creature has no where they can move, they are knocked prone but not moved, and you pass over them. A creature takes {{proficiency}}d6 + {{strength:modifier}} bludgeoning damage on a failed save.

            <p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to hurl a Small or smaller object (including weapons for creatures of Medium size) at a target. Make an attack treating the object as a simple melee weapon with the thrown 60/180 property unless it already has a longer thrown range. On hit, the creature takes 2d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage (replaced by the weapons damage type when throwing a weapon) and must make a Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and dazed†. The number of d6 increases by one when your proficiency bonus increases (with the total number of d6 equaling your proficiency bonus).</p>
