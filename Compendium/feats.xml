            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
                <li><strong>Skeleton Carving.</strong> You gain a natural weapon that deals 2d4 damage (piercing or slashing, your choice) or Increase your AC by 1. If you already have a natural weapon and select a natural weapon , you can increase the damage of your existing natural weapon by a d2 step instead (from a d6 to a d8, for example). If a natural weapon has multiple damage dice, increase only one this way.</li>

            This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Large or smaller creatures in your path must make a Strength saving throw, or be knocked out of your way and prone. If a creature has no where they can move, they are knocked prone but not moved, and you pass over them. A creature takes {{proficiency}}d6 + {{strength:modifier}} bludgeoning damage on a failed save.

            <description>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack by turning into lightning, leaping (as lightning) to a creature or empty space within 10 feet. If you target a creature, you can target a chain of creatures within {{lightningleaprange}} feet of the previous target, targeting a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. Each creature you target makes a Dexterity saving, taking {{proficiency}}d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. You then teleport to an empty spot of your choice adjacent to the last target of the chain..</description>

        <description>
            <p>You master an esoteric art of vanishing and leaving something (or someone) behind in your space, swapping positions with them. You gain the following abilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decoy Death.</strong> If you would be reduced to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you can use Nether Swap as a reaction. When you do so, you instead fall to 1 hit point, with any additional damage beyond what would reduce to 1 hit point being taken by the object you swap places with. You can do this even if you have no use remaining, but once you use it this way you cannot use it this way again until you complete a long rest. You can only target objects when using it this way.</li>
                <li>You gain the <strong>Nether Swap </strong>special bonus action.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Nether Swap</strong></p>
            <p>As a bonus action, you swap places with a Small to Large creature or object that is not being worn or carried you can see within 15 feet of you. If the target is an unwilling creature, it makes a Charisma saving throw against your Mystic Path DC. On a successful save, the ability fails and neither creature is teleported. The maximum distance increases by 5 feet when your proficiency bonus increases (always equaling 5 times your proficiency bonus).</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>

            <description>When you make a Tinkering crafting check, you can take 10 as the result of the d20 (instead of rolling) without spending additional time.
            During a long rest, you can produce two pieces of Advanced Ammunition worth less than a total of 50 gp without material components beyond pieces of ammunition. This piece of ammunition is of temporary construction, and becomes a normal piece of ammunition after 24 hours.</description>

            <p>You delve the secrets of magic. You can make scrolls of spells you don’t know, but each crafting check takes 8 hours (this can be completed incrementally). When you craft a scroll or make a magic item that reproduces a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type of that spell it reproduces. Doing so raises the difficulty of crafting it by +2. Additionally, you can cast a spell from a scroll even if it is not on your spell list. If it is higher level than you can normally cast, you have advantage on the spell casting check to cast it.</p>
