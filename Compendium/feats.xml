                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>

If you already have a natural weapon and select a natural weapon , you can increase the damage of your existing natural weapon by a d2 step instead (from a d6 to a d8, for example). If a natural weapon has multiple damage dice, increase only one this way.</li>

            This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Large or smaller creatures in your path must make a Strength saving throw, or be knocked out of your way and prone. If a creature has no where they can move, they are knocked prone but not moved, and you pass over them. A creature takes {{proficiency}}d6 + {{strength:modifier}} bludgeoning damage on a failed save.

            <description>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack by turning into lightning, leaping (as lightning) to a creature or empty space within 10 feet. If you target a creature, you can target a chain of creatures within {{lightningleaprange}} feet of the previous target, targeting a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. Each creature you target makes a Dexterity saving, taking {{proficiency}}d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.
