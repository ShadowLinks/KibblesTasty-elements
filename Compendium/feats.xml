                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>

If you already have a natural weapon and select a natural weapon , you can increase the damage of your existing natural weapon by a d2 step instead (from a d6 to a d8, for example). If a natural weapon has multiple damage dice, increase only one this way.</li>

            This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Large or smaller creatures in your path must make a Strength saving throw, or be knocked out of your way and prone. If a creature has no where they can move, they are knocked prone but not moved, and you pass over them. A creature takes {{proficiency}}d6 + {{strength:modifier}} bludgeoning damage on a failed save.

            <p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to hurl a Small or smaller object (including weapons for creatures of Medium size) at a target. Make an attack treating the object as a simple melee weapon with the thrown 60/180 property unless it already has a longer thrown range. On hit, the creature takes 2d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage (replaced by the weapons damage type when throwing a weapon) and must make a Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and dazedâ€ . The number of d6 increases by one when your proficiency bonus increases (with the total number of d6 equaling your proficiency bonus).</p>
