        <description>
            <p>A Thundersmith is an inventor who harnesses the primal force of elemental power, channeling that power into their great creation: a weapon of unmatched devastation. Spectacular and terrible, these weapons bring fear to their foes and awe to their allies.</p>
            <p class="indent">Why a Thundersmith bends their mind to the task of making such a weapon are as varied as the creations themselves. Some are coldly analytical about the destruction it causes seeking to continually improve it, tweaking it for ever more optimized destruction, while others view it merely as a tool, a means to an end; others still revel in the crash of thunder that heralds the terrifying force of their weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">Many look at these weapons as the dawn of a new age, in truth wielding them is a tricky and arcane art; as complex as its creation it is only truly understood and mastered by the one who forged the device—each weapon a unique piece of devastating art.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you harness the elemental power of thundering storms to create a powerful weapon. This weapon requires attunement, only you can attune to it, you are proficient with it while attuned, and you can only be attuned to one Stormforged Weapon at a time. If you have multiple Stormforged Weapons, you can change which one you are attuned to during a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose your Stormforged Weapon or wish to create additional ones, you can do so over the course of three days (8 hours each day) by expending 200 gp worth of metal and other raw materials.
