        <description>
            <p>A Thundersmith is an inventor who harnesses the primal force of elemental power, channeling that power into their great creation: a weapon of unmatched devastation. Spectacular and terrible, these weapons bring fear to their foes and awe to their allies.</p>
            <p class="indent">Why a Thundersmith bends their mind to the task of making such a weapon are as varied as the creations themselves. Some are coldly analytical about the destruction it causes seeking to continually improve it, tweaking it for ever more optimized destruction, while others view it merely as a tool, a means to an end; others still revel in the crash of thunder that heralds the terrifying force of their weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">Many look at these weapons as the dawn of a new age, in truth wielding them is a tricky and arcane art; as complex as its creation it is only truly understood and mastered by the one who forged the device—each weapon a unique piece of devastating art.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you harness the elemental power of thundering storms to create a powerful weapon. This weapon requires attunement, only you can attune to it, you are proficient with it while attuned, and you can only be attuned to one Stormforged Weapon at a time. If you have multiple Stormforged Weapons, you can change which one you are attuned to during a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose your Stormforged Weapon or wish to create additional ones, you can do so over the course of three days (8 hours each day) by expending 200 gp worth of metal and other raw materials. When you make a new Stormforged Weapon, you can make the same or a different type, and select the same or different upgrades.</p>
            <p class="indent">Select one of the following and consult the Stormforged Weapon table for its statistics.</p>

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a Stormcharged Weapon, you can make only one Attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. If you could otherwise make additional attacks with that action, the weapon deals an extra 3d6 lightning or thunder damage per attack that was foregone.</p>

            <p>Crafted from the salvaged sugary rocks of Sugarwater Run and enchanted by the hammers of skillful weaponsmiths, the lollyaxe is a deadly delight.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can lick the axe to activate it. The next time you hit a creature with this weapon, you mark the target for 3 rounds. The critical range of attacks made against the marked creature increases by1. To elaborate, if your attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, your attacks against a marked creature score a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20. Only one creature can be marked in this way at a time.</p>
