            <p>An Oracle is an Occultist whose power comes to them from their connection to fate; bound and empowered Oracles carry some piece of divine mystery within them, tied to an aspect of destiny and fate. As their power grows they begin to understand this mystery with revelations, unlocking its secrets and the power they contain. An Oracle typically does not directly serve a god, rather they often are people whose fate has entangled them in the affairs of the gods. Oracles have great power, but their powers are not ones that mortals were meant to have, and consequently they are frequently burdened by their powers.</p>

            <p>As you delve into your Tradition of occult magic, you find deviations and branches to explore that help you specialize and perfect your craft in the way that best suits you.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 2nd Level, you gain two occult rites of your choice. Your occult rites options are detailed at the end of the occult tradition description for tradition specific Rites, and at the end of the class description for general rites. You can select from either your tradition or class list. When you gain certain Occultist levels, you gain additional occult rites of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the occult rites you know and replace it with another occult rite that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in an occult rite refers to Occultist level, not character level.</p>
