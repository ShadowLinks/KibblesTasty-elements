        <description>
            <p>You have made a pact of sorts with an intelligence that defies normal understanding; its aims are mysterious and often incomprehensible. This being could be an artificial intelligence of some lost race of ancients with fabulous technology, perhaps a high ranking mechanical overmind. They could even be an ancient lost rogue one, perhaps an Inventor of another era whose last act was to upload themselves in an incorporeal form, or perhaps it something more alien, the ancient navigation system of an otherworldly ship that has gained sentience.</p>
            <p class="indent">The possibilities are endless, but whatever its nature, it can grant you sufficiently advanced knowledge that for all intents and purposes is fabulous magical power.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, you gain access to a device granted to by your patron that grants some access to their vast knowledge, systems, and power. Your contraption is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the contraption is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron.</p>
            <p class="indent">This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous contraption is destroyed if it still exists. The contraption may vanish in a flash of light when you die.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you are possession of the contraption, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <h5>Autocaster</h5>
            <p class="indent">Your contraption serves as a repository for additional spells. At the end of a long rest, you can store spells from your Expanded Spell List, or any spell of the divination school of magic that is of a level you could cast. You can have a combined prepared level of spells equal to your proficiency bonus (for example, at 5th level when your proficiency bonus is +3, you can have it store three 1st-level spells, or one 3rd-level spell).</p>
            <p class="indent">Each spell stored in the Autocaster can be cast without expending a warlock spell slot to cast the spell once, after which you can’t cast it without expending a spell slot again until you finish a long rest. You can cast the spell stored again before finishing a long rest by expending a warlock spell slot of equal or greater level to the stored spell.</p>
            <h5>Firing Solution</h5>
            <p class="indent">Your contraption begins to develop the best way to hit a target. While you possess your contraption, you can use it to cast true strike. You can accelerate the calculations and cast true strike as a bonus action a number of times equal to your Spellcasting modifier. When you cast true strike using your contraption, it doesn’t require concentration.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can do this a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier before you must finish a long rest to do so again.</p>
