            <p>Acid rain begins falling within a 40-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. When a creature moves into the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d4 acid damage and is covered in acid. On a success, a creature takes half the initial damage and is not covered in acid.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature takes 3d4 acid damage if it ends its turn while covered in acid. The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can end this damage by using its action to clear away the acid.</p>

            <p>You open a pit filled with acid at a point within range. Each creature within 10 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls 5 feet into a pit of acid below, taking 6d4 + 6 acid damage. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage from the flooding acid and can use its reaction to move up to its movement speed to the closest point outside of the area. If it cannot take a reaction or reach a safe space, it automatically fails its saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature ends its turn in the pit, it takes 2d4 acid damage. The acid in the pit remains potent for 1 minute, after which it turns to vile sludge that deals no further damage. The pit remains filled with sludge until filled or cleared.</p>

            <p>Targeting a creature you can see within range, you bring its shadow to life under your control. If the creature has a challenge rating above 3 or has no shadow (either due to its nature or from the lack of a light source to cast one) the spell fails. Creatures without a challenge rating are immune to this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">Otherwise, a copy of the creature is created using its game statistics in a space adjacent to the creature (on the opposite side as the nearest bright light). The shadow has no legendary actions, legendary resistance, and cannot cast spells. The shadow has hit points equal to half the target’s hit points, and it looks like a mirrored version of the creature it was summoned from, formed from inky black smoke. The shadow is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources while in darkness. The shadow is vulnerable to all damage while in bright light, and always vulnerable to fire, lightning, and radiant damage. If the shadow is killed, the target creature it was summoned from casts no shadows for the next 8 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">The shadow acts immediately after the target's turn, and without further direction it attempts to follow and takes the Attack action against the target. As a reaction to the shadow starting its turn, you can exert control over it and cause it to move and take its action as you direct.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>At Higher Levels. </i></strong>When you cast this spell using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating of the target increases to 4. When you cast it using a 7th- or 8th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating increases to 5. When you cast it using a 9th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating increases to CR 6.</p>

Each creature within 5 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it moves to the closest unoccupied space outside of the radius. If no space is available or a creature cannot move, it automatically fails. On a failure, a creature takes 10d10 + 10 bludgeoning damage. Creatures within 20 feet of the target point take 4d4 thunder damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the path of the anvil (directly above the target point) is interrupted, the creature or object above it is hit first.

            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Bind.</em></strong> The rope attempts to bind a creature of your choice within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the rope (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the rope.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Fasten.</em></strong> The rope flies up 60 feet and ties one end of itself to an object or surface that a rope could be tied to, before becoming inanimate again, hanging from the object.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Grab.</em></strong> The rope lashes out at an object within its length and grabs one Small or smaller object that is not being worn by a creature, pulling it back to your hand. If the object is being carried by a creature, the creature can make a Strength saving throw. On a success, the object is not pulled.</li>

        <supports>Sorcerer, Wizard, Spell Saving Throw</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You create a miniature black hole at a point within range. An event horizon forms in a 15-foot radius around the point, engulfing anything (including light, sound, and magical effects) in the area.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the black hole appears, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being engulfed. On a success, it can move up to its movement speed out of the event horizon of the black hole. If it cannot move to a safe space outside of the event horizon, it automatically fails the save and is engulfed.</p>
            <p class="indent">An engulfed creature is compressed into the point at the center of the spell, taking 12d12 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns while engulfed. Its speed is 0, and it is blinded, deafened, and restrained while engulfed. As an action, an engulfed creature can attempt to forcibly exit the black hole by making a Strength ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature appears in an empty space at the edge of the event horizon.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any spells, effects, terrain, or items that are not being worn or carried that are engulfed within the event horizon vanish and are destroyed. Magical items of Legendary or Artifact rarity are not destroyed, instead reappearing on the ground where the sphere was when the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the spell persists, all movement away from it while within 120 feet of it is considered difficult terrain. All ranged attacks that pass within 120 feet of it have disadvantage. When a creature starts its turn within 120 feet of the black hole, it is pulled 5 feet toward the black hole. At the start of the caster’s turn, all objects within 120 feet of the black hole that weigh less than 1000 pounds, are not being worn or carried, and are not attached to the ground are pulled 20 feet toward the black hole.</p>

            <p class="indent">The brambles wither and die after 1 day if the area isn’t suitable for them to grow. A creature can clear a 5-foot square with 1 minute of labor, or instantly by inflicting at least 5 points of fire damage. The brambles crumble to dust immediately if you cast this spell again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create two additional 5-foot squares of brambles for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

Each 15-foot square is difficult terrain. When you cast the spell, each plant makes one attack against a creature of your choice within 5 feet of it.

Each plant regains all its hit points at the start of your turn if it has at least 1 hit point, and dies if it is reduced to zero hit points.

        <description>
            <p>You choose a 10-foot square area on the ground in an area of dirt or natural stone you can see. The ground buckles and opens into a 10-foot deep pit. If the surface is not large enough to contain the pit, the spell fails. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, a creature jumps to a space 5 feet outside the spell's radius. On a failure, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit (taking normal falling damage). The sides of the pit are rough, and can be climbed. A creature that saves but cannot locate an empty space to move to falls prone, hanging from the edge of the pit, and cannot stand until it moves out of the pit area or drops into it. The pit remains until filled.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the pit is 5 feet deeper for each slot level above 1st, to a maximum of 20 feet deep.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell may fail if the pit would breach another opening (such as a room or cavern below), as that would be failing to contain the pit. The GM has wide discretion on what surfaces are valid targets for this spell.</p>

            <p>Your shadow elongates into a horrifying abomination and attempts to consume the shadow of a creature you choose in range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target's shadow is devoured. It takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is magically weakened, subtracting 1d4 from its attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for the duration, and adding 1d4 to your attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for the duration. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.</p>

On a failure, it takes 3d6 fire damage and is flung up to half the cyclone's height, landing 15 feet outside the cyclone in a randomly determined horizontal direction. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not flung.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature starts its turn outside the cyclone but within 30 feet of its center, it feels the cyclone's pull and must spend 2 feet (or 3 feet if it is flying) of movement for every 1 foot it moves away from the cyclone.</p>
            <p class="indent">For the duration of the spell, you can use your action to move the cyclone up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the cyclone's damage increases by 1d6 and its height increases by 5 feet for each level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>You set a magical trap, infusing explosive magic into an object. You can set the item to detonate when someone comes within 5 feet of it, or at a verbal command by you. You can issue this command as an action or as a reaction when you see a creature move within 20 feet of a mine, detonating every mine keyed to the verbal command simultaneously</p>
            <p class="indent">When the magic trap detonates, each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the item must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. If a creature is in the area of effect of more than one fireburst mine during a turn, it takes half damage from any mines beyond the first.</p>
            <p class="indent">A magical mine must be set at least 5 feet away from every other mine, and cannot be moved once placed; any attempt to move it results in it detonating. The caster can permanently disarm a mine as an action.</p>

            <p>A golden pillar of celestial radiance shines down in a 10-foot radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the cylinder is filled with bright light and sheds dim light for 10 feet in all directions from it.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the celestial radiance infuses its body with positive energy. If the creature is not an undead or construct, it regains 2d8 hit points and gains 2d8 temporary hit points. If it is a construct, the light has no effect. If it is undead, it instead takes 2d8 radiant damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">The first time a creature is healed by this spell, it is healed without restriction; every subsequent time a creature is healed by this spell, it can't be healed above half its maximum hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can move the pillar up to 60 feet in any direction.</p>

            <p>You open a pit to hell beneath the feet of your foes. A supernatural void opens in a 10-foot radius, 10-foot deep pit opens around a point you can see within range.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On success, they can move 5 feet outside the radius of the spell. If they cannot move 5 feet out of the radius of the spell (such as having no path or insufficient movement speed), they automatically fail the saving throw. Creatures that fall their saving throw fall to the bottom of the bit (taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and falling prone). The floor of the pit is a blazing inferno of hell. Creatures that start their turn in the pit take 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 necrotic damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">The pit is difficult to escape, voraciously drawing creatures caught in to the depths of hell with strong winds, roaring fires, and infernal chains. A creature can spend 20 feet of movement (or 10 if they a flying or climbing speed) to attempt to escape the pit, making a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On success, they escape. On failure, fall back to the floor of the pit and their movement speed becomes 0 until the start of their next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, the supernatural void to hell closes, and all creatures in the pit are deposited on the ground where the pit opened prone.</p>

            <p>You create an illusory duplicate of every allied creature of your choice within 30 feet. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move alongside their real counterparts and mimic their actions, making it impossible to track which is real.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time an affected creature is attacked, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets the duplicate. On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack targets the duplicate. A duplicate's AC equals 10 + the real creature’s Dexterity modifier. If a duplicate is hit by an attack, it is destroyed. Duplicates ignore all other damage and effects, and the spell ends once all duplicates have been destroyed.</p>

            <p>You shroud the mind of a creature you can see within range in shadow, twisting its view of the world. The target perceives everything beyond 15 feet as wreathed in shadow, indistinct in shape and sound. When the target attempts to target a creature wreathed in shadow with an attack or spell, it must pass a Wisdom saving throw, or it instead targets a random different target within range. When the target becomes able to see a creature that was previously wreathed in shadow, it must pass a Wisdom saving throw, or become frightened of that creature until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of each of the target's turns, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the shadows draw 5 feet closer, closing off the distance the target can see clearly. If the target’s entire vision becomes shrouded in shadow (after its third failure), it becomes paralyzed with fear until it succeeds on this save. If the target succeeds on this saving throw, the spell ends.</p>

                <li>You grow one additional appendage. This appendage functions as an arm and a hand, though it can take the shape of an arm, tentacle, or similar appendage.</li>
                <li>You extend the length of your limbs, increasing the reach of your melee attacks, touch spells, and object interactions by 5 feet.</li>
                <li>Your flesh hardens. You can calculate your AC as 14 + your Dexterity modifier</li>
                <li>You grow more resilient, adapting against one external threat. You gain advantage on saving throws with one ability of your choice.</li>

                <li>Your body gains a regenerating carapace. You gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of your turns.</li>
                <li>You can change your size by one category.</li>
                <li>You sprout wings, gaining a flying speed of 30 feet.</li>
                <li>You grow a natural weapon, which can have the statistics of any martial melee weapon without the thrown property, and takes on an appropriate form.</li>

            <p>You are proficient with this weapon and are considered to be wielding it. You can use your spellcasting modifier in place of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls with it. This natural weapon is magical and gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls.</p>

            <p>You summon a ghostly echo of yourself. It shares your space and acts automatically, mirroring your actions. The first time on your turn you make a weapon attack, it attacks the same target. It makes a separate attack roll using your attack modifier. On a hit, roll your attack's normal damage; the target takes force damage equal to half the result.</p>

            <p>You call forth a spirit to aid you with your ability checks. Choose one skill out of Arcana, Animal Handling, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, or Survival. The spirit is proficient in the chosen skill.

            <p class="indent">For the duration, you can treat any check you make in the skill as if you have proficiency with it so long as the spirit can communicate with you. Alternatively, the spirit can make Intelligence or Wisdom checks itself, with a +5 modifier. The spirit will follow you, staying within of you at all times. You can choose to release it early, dismissing it back from whence it came.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spirit’s bonus on making ability checks directly increases by 1 for each slot level above 1st, up to a maximum of +9.</p>

The tree must grow on dirt, sand, or another appropriate surface. At the DM's discretion, it can burst through up to 6 inches of hard material. The tree stops growing if it would hit a ceiling or other object.</p>

A Large or smaller creature can choose to fail this save, while a Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds.</p>

            <p>You touch a piece of ammunition or weapon with the thrown property, imbuing it with a crackling storm of power for the duration. The first time you attack with the weapon, it explodes into a raging storm on reaching its destination. On a hit, the target takes an additional 4d8 lightning damage. On a miss, the target takes half as much damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hit or miss, the target and all creatures within 20 feet of it must make a Strength saving throw against the raging storm unleashed by the attack. On a failed, a creature is thrown 20 feet straight up (falling immediately if not otherwise held aloft) and takes 2d8 lightning damage. On a successful save, it is not thrown into the air and takes half as much lightning damage.</p>

            <p>You create a whirling sphere of air around a creature that causes them to struggle to breathe. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it loses 5d8 hit points due to lack of air, has disadvantage on all ability checks, and cannot speak. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. For the duration, as an action, you can force the creature to repeat this saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a target fails its saving throw against this spell 3 times in a row, it becomes incapacitated until it succeeds on a save or the spell ends. If you don’t use your action to force the target to make a save, it automatically attempts the save and succeeds at the end of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that does not need to breathe is unaffected by this spell.</p>

Swinging blades, lava flows, or other phantom hazards fill the minds of each creature of your choice within the area. An affected creature can move at half speed to evade the dangers, or move at its normal speed and take 1d8 psychic damage for each 5 feet it moves within the area. Any affected creature ending its turn in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 5d8 psychic damage on a failure or half as much on a success.</p>

            <p>You call forth a magical swarm, which manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.

            <p>You cast a curse targeting two individuals. Both targets must make a Charisma saving throw (which they can choose to fail). If both targets fail their saving throws, their souls are swapped for the duration. A soul controls the body it inhabits. It uses the ability scores and actions of its new body (except legendary actions or legendary resistance), but retains its own spellcasting (if any), and has disadvantage on attack rolls and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws for 1d4 turns after swapping bodies.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of a swapped creature's turn, it can choose to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If its challenge rating (or character level if it has no challenge rating) is higher than that of its current body, it has advantage on the save.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature dies while its soul is swapped, both souls return to their original bodies. After a soul returns from a dying creature to a living body, it takes 5d10 necrotic damage.</p>

            <p>You set a magical trap, infusing thunderous magic into an object. You can set the item to detonate when someone comes within 5 feet of it, or at a verbal command by you. You can issue this command as an action or as a reaction when you see a creature move within 20 feet of a mine, detonating every mine keyed to the verbal command simultaneously.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the magic trap detonates, each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the item must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a fail, or half as much damage on a success.

            <p class="indent">A magical mine must be set at least 5 feet away from every other mine, and cannot be moved once placed; any attempt to move it results in it detonating. The caster can permanently disarm a mine as an action.</p>

If you would take damage from an attack or fail a saving throw against a spell of 2nd level or lower, you can use your reaction to revert your personal timeline and negate the effect — causing the attack to miss or the save to succeed. Afterward, this spell ends.</p>

When you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on each subsequent turn, you can cause the vapors to surge out and swirl around up to three creatures of your choice within range. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d12 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much poison damage and is not poisoned.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You cast a curse targeting two creatures. Both targets must make a Charisma saving throw (which they can choose to fail). If both targets fail their saving throws, for the duration of the spell their souls are swapped. A soul controls the body it inhabits. It gains any ability score, actions, or abilities the body had (besides legendary actions or legendary resistance), but retains its own spell casting (if it has the spellcasting, innate or similar feature), and has disadvantage on all attack rolls and strength, dexterity, and constitution saving throws for 1d4 turns after swapping bodies.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of a swapped creature’s turn, it can choose to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save. If its CR (or character level if it has no CR) is higher than the body of the creature it was swapped into, it has advantage on the save.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature dies while its soul is swapped, the souls return to their original bodies. If a soul was in a dying creature that returns to a living body, that creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> If you use a 9th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled and grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em>Remove Curse</em> spell cast at the samne level ends the effect.</p>

Up to 5 creatures of your choice (other than the target) of the same creature type within range are bound to that creature by a magical curse.

            <p class="indent">When that creature becomes bloodied (reduced to less than half its maximum hit points) and again if that creature dies, all creatures effected by the curse must make a Charisma saving throw, taking 5d6 + twice the cursed creature’s CR (or level) necrotic damage on failed save, or half as much on success. This curse has no effect on creatures without blood.</p>
