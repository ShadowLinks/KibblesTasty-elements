            <p>Acid rain begins falling within a 40-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. When a creature moves into the spellâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d4 acid damage and is covered in acid. On a success, a creature takes half the initial damage and is not covered in acid.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature takes 3d4 acid damage if it ends its turn while covered in acid. The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can end this damage by using its action to clear away the acid.</p>

            <p>You open a pit filled with acid at a point within range. Each creature within 10 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls 5 feet into a pit of acid below, taking 6d4 + 6 acid damage. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage from the flooding acid and can use its reaction to move up to its movement speed to the closest point outside of the area. If it cannot take a reaction or reach a safe space, it automatically fails its saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature ends its turn in the pit, it takes 2d4 acid damage. The acid in the pit remains potent for 1 minute, after which it turns to vile sludge that deals no further damage. The pit remains filled with sludge until filled or cleared.</p>

            <p>Targeting a creature you can see within range, you bring its shadow to life under your control. If the creature has a challenge rating above 3 or has no shadow (either due to its nature or from the lack of a light source to cast one) the spell fails. Creatures without a challenge rating are immune to this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">Otherwise, a copy of the creature is created using its game statistics in a space adjacent to the creature (on the opposite side as the nearest bright light). The shadow has no legendary actions, legendary resistance, and cannot cast spells. The shadow has hit points equal to half the targetâ€™s hit points, and it looks like a mirrored version of the creature it was summoned from, formed from inky black smoke. The shadow is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources while in darkness. The shadow is vulnerable to all damage while in bright light, and always vulnerable to fire, lightning, and radiant damage. If the shadow is killed, the target creature it was summoned from casts no shadows for the next 8 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">The shadow acts immediately after the target's turn, and without further direction it attempts to follow and takes the Attack action against the target. As a reaction to the shadow starting its turn, you can exert control over it and cause it to move and take its action as you direct.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>At Higher Levels. </i></strong>When you cast this spell using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating of the target increases to 4. When you cast it using a 7th- or 8th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating increases to 5. When you cast it using a 9th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating increases to CR 6.</p>

Each creature within 5 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it moves to the closest unoccupied space outside of the radius. If no space is available or a creature cannot move, it automatically fails. On a failure, a creature takes 10d10 + 10 bludgeoning damage. Creatures within 20 feet of the target point take 4d4 thunder damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the path of the anvil (directly above the target point) is interrupted, the creature or object above it is hit first. If the creature or object is killed or destroyed, the anvil continues, though the damage dealt is subtracted from the final impact damage of the anvil.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Bind.</em></strong> The rope attempts to bind a creature of your choice within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the rope (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the rope.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Fasten.</em></strong> The rope flies up 60 feet and ties one end of itself to an object or surface that a rope could be tied to, before becoming inanimate again, hanging from the object.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Grab.</em></strong> The rope lashes out at an object within its length and grabs one Small or smaller object that is not being worn by a creature, pulling it back to your hand. If the object is being carried by a creature, the creature can make a Strength saving throw. On a success, the object is not pulled.</li>
            </ul>

        <description>
            <p>You create a miniature black hole at a point within range. An event horizon forms in a 15-foot radius around the point, engulfing anything (including light, sound, and magical effects) in the area.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the black hole appears, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being engulfed. On a success, it can move up to its movement speed out of the event horizon of the black hole. If it cannot move to a safe space outside of the event horizon, it automatically fails the save and is engulfed.</p>
            <p class="indent">An engulfed creature is compressed into the point at the center of the spell, taking 12d12 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns while engulfed. Its speed is 0, and it is blinded, deafened, and restrained while engulfed. As an action, an engulfed creature can attempt to forcibly exit the black hole by making a Strength ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature appears in an empty space at the edge of the event horizon.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any spells, effects, terrain, or items that are not being worn or carried that are engulfed within the event horizon vanish and are destroyed. Magical items of Legendary or Artifact rarity are not destroyed, instead reappearing on the ground where the sphere was when the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the spell persists, all movement away from it while within 120 feet of it is considered difficult terrain. All ranged attacks that pass within 120 feet of it have disadvantage. When a creature starts its turn within 120 feet of the black hole, it is pulled 5 feet toward the black hole. At the start of the casterâ€™s turn, all objects within 120 feet of the black hole that weigh less than 1000 pounds, are not being worn or carried, and are not attached to the ground are pulled 20 feet toward the black hole.</p>

            <p class="indent">The brambles wither and die after 1 day if the area isnâ€™t suitable for them to grow. A creature can clear a 5-foot square with 1 minute of labor, or instantly by inflicting at least 5 points of fire damage. The brambles crumble to dust immediately if you cast this spell again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create two additional 5-foot squares of brambles for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>Brambles burst from your hand, lashing out at a target within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 4d4 piercing damage and, if it is Large or smaller, becomes entangled by brambles. While entangled by brambles, it canâ€™t move, but it can free itself as an action (taking no additional damage) or rip itself free using half of its movement and taking an additional 2d4 piercing damage. On a success, it takes half as much damage and isn't entangled by brambles.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the initial damage and the damage taken ripping free of the brambles increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

            <p>You touch a weapon or a piece of ammunition, imbuing it with licking flames. The next time you attack with the empowered item, it bursts into brilliant fire. On a hit, the target takes an additional 4d4 fire damage and begins to burn. On a miss, the target takes half as much damage and does not start to burn. A burning target sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns. The target or another creature within 5 feet can use an action to extinguish the flames.</p>
