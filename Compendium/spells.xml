            <p>Acid rain begins falling within a 40-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. When a creature moves into the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d4 acid damage and is covered in acid. On a success, a creature takes half the initial damage and is not covered in acid.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature takes 3d4 acid damage if it ends its turn while covered in acid. The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can end this damage by using its action to clear away the acid.</p>

            <p>You open a pit filled with acid at a point within range. Each creature within 10 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls 5 feet into a pit of acid below, taking 6d4 + 6 acid damage. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage from the flooding acid and can use its reaction to move up to its movement speed to the closest point outside of the area. If it cannot take a reaction or reach a safe space, it automatically fails its saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature ends its turn in the pit, it takes 2d4 acid damage. The acid in the pit remains potent for 1 minute, after which it turns to vile sludge that deals no further damage. The pit remains filled with sludge until filled or cleared.</p>

            <p>Targeting a creature you can see within range, you bring its shadow to life under your control. If the creature has a challenge rating above 3 or has no shadow (either due to its nature or from the lack of a light source to cast one) the spell fails. Creatures without a challenge rating are immune to this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">Otherwise, a copy of the creature is created using its game statistics in a space adjacent to the creature (on the opposite side as the nearest bright light). The shadow has no legendary actions, legendary resistance, and cannot cast spells. The shadow has hit points equal to half the target’s hit points, and it looks like a mirrored version of the creature it was summoned from, formed from inky black smoke. The shadow is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources while in darkness. The shadow is vulnerable to all damage while in bright light, and always vulnerable to fire, lightning, and radiant damage. If the shadow is killed, the target creature it was summoned from casts no shadows for the next 8 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">The shadow acts immediately after the target's turn, and without further direction it attempts to follow and takes the Attack action against the target. As a reaction to the shadow starting its turn, you can exert control over it and cause it to move and take its action as you direct.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>At Higher Levels. </i></strong>When you cast this spell using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating of the target increases to 4. When you cast it using a 7th- or 8th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating increases to 5. When you cast it using a 9th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating increases to CR 6.</p>

Each creature within 5 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it moves to the closest unoccupied space outside of the radius. If no space is available or a creature cannot move, it automatically fails. On a failure, a creature takes 10d10 + 10 bludgeoning damage. Creatures within 20 feet of the target point take 4d4 thunder damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the path of the anvil (directly above the target point) is interrupted, the creature or object above it is hit first.

            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Bind.</em></strong> The rope attempts to bind a creature of your choice within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the rope (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the rope.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Fasten.</em></strong> The rope flies up 60 feet and ties one end of itself to an object or surface that a rope could be tied to, before becoming inanimate again, hanging from the object.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Grab.</em></strong> The rope lashes out at an object within its length and grabs one Small or smaller object that is not being worn by a creature, pulling it back to your hand. If the object is being carried by a creature, the creature can make a Strength saving throw. On a success, the object is not pulled.</li>

        <supports>Sorcerer, Wizard, Spell Saving Throw</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You create a miniature black hole at a point within range. An event horizon forms in a 15-foot radius around the point, engulfing anything (including light, sound, and magical effects) in the area.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the black hole appears, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being engulfed. On a success, it can move up to its movement speed out of the event horizon of the black hole. If it cannot move to a safe space outside of the event horizon, it automatically fails the save and is engulfed.</p>
            <p class="indent">An engulfed creature is compressed into the point at the center of the spell, taking 12d12 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns while engulfed. Its speed is 0, and it is blinded, deafened, and restrained while engulfed. As an action, an engulfed creature can attempt to forcibly exit the black hole by making a Strength ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature appears in an empty space at the edge of the event horizon.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any spells, effects, terrain, or items that are not being worn or carried that are engulfed within the event horizon vanish and are destroyed. Magical items of Legendary or Artifact rarity are not destroyed, instead reappearing on the ground where the sphere was when the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the spell persists, all movement away from it while within 120 feet of it is considered difficult terrain. All ranged attacks that pass within 120 feet of it have disadvantage. When a creature starts its turn within 120 feet of the black hole, it is pulled 5 feet toward the black hole. At the start of the caster’s turn, all objects within 120 feet of the black hole that weigh less than 1000 pounds, are not being worn or carried, and are not attached to the ground are pulled 20 feet toward the black hole.</p>

            <p class="indent">The brambles wither and die after 1 day if the area isn’t suitable for them to grow. A creature can clear a 5-foot square with 1 minute of labor, or instantly by inflicting at least 5 points of fire damage. The brambles crumble to dust immediately if you cast this spell again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create two additional 5-foot squares of brambles for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

Each 15-foot square is difficult terrain. When you cast the spell, each plant makes one attack against a creature of your choice within 5 feet of it.

Each plant regains all its hit points at the start of your turn if it has at least 1 hit point, and dies if it is reduced to zero hit points.

        <description>
            <p>You choose a 10-foot square area on the ground in an area of dirt or natural stone you can see. The ground buckles and opens into a 10-foot deep pit. If the surface is not large enough to contain the pit, the spell fails. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, a creature jumps to a space 5 feet outside the spell's radius. On a failure, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit (taking normal falling damage). The sides of the pit are rough, and can be climbed. A creature that saves but cannot locate an empty space to move to falls prone, hanging from the edge of the pit, and cannot stand until it moves out of the pit area or drops into it. The pit remains until filled.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the pit is 5 feet deeper for each slot level above 1st, to a maximum of 20 feet deep.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell may fail if the pit would breach another opening (such as a room or cavern below), as that would be failing to contain the pit. The GM has wide discretion on what surfaces are valid targets for this spell.</p>

            <p>Your shadow elongates into a horrifying abomination and attempts to consume the shadow of a creature you choose in range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target's shadow is devoured. It takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is magically weakened, subtracting 1d4 from its attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for the duration, and adding 1d4 to your attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for the duration. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.</p>
