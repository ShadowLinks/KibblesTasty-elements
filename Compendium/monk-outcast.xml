        <description>
            <p>An Outcast is a monk that has lost their Way. Trained in the basics of the style, they have abandoned the rigorous discipline and philosophy of their tradition, and are usually now enrolled only in the school of hard knocks.</p>
            <p class="indent">Having been trained in the fundamentals of the art of ki, these monks choose as often as not to apply that art to tavern brawls and street fights. Much to the horror of many more formal monks, their rough and tumble lifestyle tends to be a solid source of further training.</p>
            <p class="indent">With great power comes great responsibility? These monks are going to stick with just the great power, thank you very much. Almost always Chaotic, they can range the spectrum from Good to Evil and everything in between just as easily. A distaste for the rigorous philosophy of an order does not mean a penchant for Evil, but Evil and vice can sometimes lead a monk down this road.</p>
