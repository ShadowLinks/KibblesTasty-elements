        <description>
            <p>A human runs her hand across their blade tracing esoteric patterns that alight at a touch, flames flickering alive in their wake casting a sudden blazing light over the gloomy cavern, creatures of the dark shrinking back from the fire’s light. A gnome’s eyes begin to glow as a massive greatsword of energy condenses into their waiting hand, forming a blade of pure energy, twice their height but weightless in their hands. The edgy elf vanishes from sight, teleporting behind their foe before muttering something cryptically and cutting them down.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Spellblade combines magic and martial talent in a perfect blend, able to blend their use of them into a single art. Rather than being a Wizard that happens to be good with a sword or a Fighter that knows some magic, a Spellblade is defined by their ability to merge the spells and martial talents into a single strike: a Spellstrike.</p>
            <h4>Pursuit of Mastery</h4>
            <p>Becoming a Spellblade isn’t an accident—it’s a difficult path to master and requires intense concentration and conditioning to master fluidly casting spells in the storm of battle in perfect sync with your attacks. Spellblades are, consequently, almost always driven by some form of motivation that have made them strive for this unique style of perfection. Some view it as an art or tradition important to them, some view it as the ultimate weapon to overcome a great obstacle, and some pursue it because of the challenge itself, seeking to prove themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>Rare Talent</h4>
            <p>Spellblades are uncommon, requiring an unusual degree of talent to master their arts compared to those that choose to focus and specialize in only one of their two challenging fields. Adventurers are already a rare breed, but Spellblades are rarer still, which often causes them to defy expectations. A bookish and mild Spellblade may be surprisingly nimble or strong, while one that may look a musclebound oaf may be surprisingly erudite.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>CREATING A SPELLBLADE</h4>
            <p>The most important place to start when making a Spellblade is knowing what drew your character to this difficult and rare path. The path of a Spellblade is one that has few mundane uses—they are not scholars and their skills serve little purpose outside the adventuring arts, so what drove your character to master these? There’s an intentionality to a Spellblade similar to that which might be found in a Paladin.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Spellblade quickly by following these suggestions.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you wish to follow the technique of the Aether Blade, Battlemage, or Flying Sword, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Dexterity, and then Constitution.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you wish to follow the technique of the Guardian or Spellfist, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution, and then Intelligence.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you wish to follow the technique of the Mage Hunter, Rimeblade, Spellshot, or Swiftblade, put your highest ability score in Dexterity, followed by Intelligence, and then Constitution.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <p>As part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells at 2nd level. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with enhancing your abilities and devastating your foes.</p>
            <h4>Cantrips</h4>
            <p>At 2nd level, you learn two additional cantrips of your choice from the Spellblade spell list. You learn additional Spellblade cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Spellblade table. The table includes the bonus cantrips gained from Spellblade class features (such as Empowered Strike).</p>
            <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
            <p>The Spellblade table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Spellblade spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of your Spellblade spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
            <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Spellblade spell list. The Spells Known column of the Spellblade table shows when you learn more Spellblade spells of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Spellblade spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Spellblade spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Spellblade spells. Your magic comes from a practitioner’s knowledge of the arcane and training. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Spellblade spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
            <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Spellblade spells.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can infuse spells into your weapon. As a bonus action, you can cast a 1st level or higher Spellblade spell with a casting time of 1 action in a special way, infusing it into a melee weapon instead of having it immediately take effect. The next time you make a melee attack with that weapon before the end of your turn, the spell is cast against the target of the attack. The spell fizzles and fails to cast if you cast another spell before attacking.</p>
            <p class="indent">Spellstrike’s interaction with the spell mechanics is determined by the spell’s effect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attack Rolls.</strong> If the spell requires an attack roll (melee or ranged) it automatically hits the target if the weapon attack hits and misses the target if the weapon attack misses.</li>
                <li><strong>Saving Throws.</strong> If the spell has a saving throw, it automatically deals damage as if the target failed its saving throw against the spell on hit, but if it has any effects besides dealing damage, the target makes the save against those effects as normal for being targeted by the spell (regardless if the attack hits or misses). If a spell does half damage to targets that pass their save, they take half damage on a missed attack, treating it as if they had passed their saving throw. If a spell always hits (such as magic missile), the spell hits regardless if you hit or miss your attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Area of Effect.</strong> If the spell has an area of effect, that area of effect must include the space the target of the Spellstrike is in, be placed such that one edge of it is within the range of your weapon, and otherwise follows the rules of the spell regarding placement and range. Other creatures caught in the area of effect treat the spell as if you had cast it normally. The target is not affected by the spell again (having already resolved as part of the attack).</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Attack Rolls.</strong> Spells that have multiple attack rolls (such as scorching ray or crackleK) tie the outcome of only the first attack roll to the melee weapon attack. You resolve all subsequent attack rolls of the spell as if you had cast the spell, but can ignore the disadvantage on ranged attack rolls from being within 5 feet of hostile creatures when doing so.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You can only cast spells that are on the Spellblade class list using Spellstrike, and can only cast them at a level you can cast them as a Spellblade, though you can use any spell slot you have available to cast the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">Critical Strikes. If the attack critically strikes, a spell that has a spell attack roll used with spell strike also critical strikes, but a spell that has a saving throw just treats it the same as a hit (inflict wounds would critical strike, but fireball would not, as it cannot critically strike). Condition Sequence. Any effects that require the target to fail a saving throw take place after the attack. For example, if you spellstrike hold person, the saving throw against being paralyzed (and the condition if they fail) take place after the attack roll is complete. Area of Effect. One edge of the spell must be in range of the weapon, but the center point of the spell does not need to be. For example, with spellstriking fireball, you don’t need to hit yourself with. One edge of the spell must be within range, and the target must be inside the area of effect, but the center point of the spell can further away.</p>
