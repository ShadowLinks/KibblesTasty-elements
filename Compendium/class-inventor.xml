        <description>
            <p>Makers of magic-infused objects, inventors are defined by their innovative nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of thorough study and investigation. Inventors, though, focus on creating marvelous, new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable, useful items.</p>
            <h4>CUNNING CREATORS</h4>
            <p>Every inventor is defined by a specific craft. Inventors see mastering the basics of a craft as the first step towards true progress, the invention of new methods, and innovative approaches. Inventors are arcane engineers, students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, magical armor, and mechanical beings that they can augment with magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">All inventors are united by their curious and creative nature. To an inventor, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year.</p>
            <p class="indent">Inventors value novelty and innovation. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.</p>
            <p class="indent">A hidden ruin might hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect for magical enhancement. Inventors win respect and renown among their kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of creation.</p>
            <h4>BOUNDLESS IMAGINATION</h4>
            <p>An inventor is not the sort to be limited by what already exists or by conventional wisdom. They combine all the tools at their disposal to go beyond—to discover new boundaries and promptly exceed them. Few things can stand in the path of an inventor with a mind to change the world.</p>
            <p class="indent">Seeking to push beyond all and striving for the new is the unifying call of inventors, but how jealously they guard their secrets can vary greatly. Some push their knowledge upon the worlds, while others hoard it.</p>
            <h4>RIVALS AND CHALLENGES</h4>
            <p>Inventors often acquire rivals—other inventors racing to be the first to unlock the secrets of the world, scrambling to be the one after whom a new magical theory or scientific breakthrough will forever be named. Theft and acquisition of stolen ideas can often become an issue when too many inventors clash over a field of expertise.</p>
            <p class="indent">Further, inventors quickly make enemies of those who would just as soon see the world unchanged.</p>
            <p class="indent">They are often viewed as dangerous upstarts or radical troublemakers with their newfangled ways of doing things.</p>
            <p class="indent">These challenges rarely daunt an inventor for long and most often simply fuel their continued drive to rise above. Inventors are rarely set in their ways, and the hated rival of last week may be a research associate the next.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN INVENTOR</h4>
            <p>When creating an inventor character, think about your character’s background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival? What drove your character down the path of becoming an inventor? Is it about curiosity and innovation, or is it about the power their inventions bring? Did your character learn from another inventor, or did they receive a vision or flash of inspiration to learn their craft?</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider how your character interacts with the world and what they represent. Consult with your GM regarding guilds or societies your character might belong to.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an inventor quickly by following these suggestions. For the Gadgetsmith, Thundersmith, Cursesmith, or Relicsmith specializations, make your highest ability score Dexterity, followed by Intelligence; for the Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, or Runesmith specializations, make Intelligence your highest, followed by Constitution or Dexterity; and for Warsmith or Fleshsmith specializations, choose either Strength or Intelligence as your highest, with Constitution as your second-highest ability score. Second, choose a background that emphasizes your connection to a guild or society.</p>
