        <description>
            <p>Makers of magic-infused objects, inventors are defined by their innovative nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of thorough study and investigation. Inventors, though, focus on creating marvelous, new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable, useful items.</p>
            <h4>CUNNING CREATORS</h4>
            <p>Every inventor is defined by a specific craft. Inventors see mastering the basics of a craft as the first step towards true progress, the invention of new methods, and innovative approaches. Inventors are arcane engineers, students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, magical armor, and mechanical beings that they can augment with magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">All inventors are united by their curious and creative nature. To an inventor, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year.</p>
            <p class="indent">Inventors value novelty and innovation. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.</p>
            <p class="indent">A hidden ruin might hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect for magical enhancement. Inventors win respect and renown among their kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of creation.</p>
            <h4>BOUNDLESS IMAGINATION</h4>
            <p>An inventor is not the sort to be limited by what already exists or by conventional wisdom. They combine all the tools at their disposal to go beyond—to discover new boundaries and promptly exceed them. Few things can stand in the path of an inventor with a mind to change the world.</p>
            <p class="indent">Seeking to push beyond all and striving for the new is the unifying call of inventors, but how jealously they guard their secrets can vary greatly. Some push their knowledge upon the worlds, while others hoard it.</p>
            <h4>RIVALS AND CHALLENGES</h4>
            <p>Inventors often acquire rivals—other inventors racing to be the first to unlock the secrets of the world, scrambling to be the one after whom a new magical theory or scientific breakthrough will forever be named. Theft and acquisition of stolen ideas can often become an issue when too many inventors clash over a field of expertise.</p>
            <p class="indent">Further, inventors quickly make enemies of those who would just as soon see the world unchanged.</p>
            <p class="indent">They are often viewed as dangerous upstarts or radical troublemakers with their newfangled ways of doing things.</p>
            <p class="indent">These challenges rarely daunt an inventor for long and most often simply fuel their continued drive to rise above. Inventors are rarely set in their ways, and the hated rival of last week may be a research associate the next.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN INVENTOR</h4>
            <p>When creating an inventor character, think about your character’s background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival? What drove your character down the path of becoming an inventor? Is it about curiosity and innovation, or is it about the power their inventions bring? Did your character learn from another inventor, or did they receive a vision or flash of inspiration to learn their craft?</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider how your character interacts with the world and what they represent. Consult with your GM regarding guilds or societies your character might belong to.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an inventor quickly by following these suggestions. For the Gadgetsmith, Thundersmith, Cursesmith, or Relicsmith specializations, make your highest ability score Dexterity, followed by Intelligence; for the Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, or Runesmith specializations, make Intelligence your highest, followed by Constitution or Dexterity; and for Warsmith or Fleshsmith specializations, choose either Strength or Intelligence as your highest, with Constitution as your second-highest ability score. Second, choose a background that emphasizes your connection to a guild or society.</p>

            <p>Additionally at 2nd level, you gain the ability to retrofit magical gear. During a long rest you can perform a ritual using any +1, +2, or +3 weapon—excluding artifacts and sentient weapons—to transfer the magic into an inventor weapon (a weapon created by a subclass feature or upgrade). For example, you can turn a +1 longsword and your Impact Gauntlet into a +1 Impact Gauntlet. This includes weapon-like Upgrades that make attack and damage rolls, such as a Warsmith’s Force Blast.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can’t transfer any properties from a magical weapon besides a bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the original weapon is destroyed in the process.</p>

            <p class="indent">At the GM’s option, this feature can be expanded to do similar tasks. For example, you may be allowed to turn a +1 heavy crossbow into a +1 light crossbow, or the GM may choose to allow this feature to work with other magical armor or weapons, such as converting adamantine chain mail into an adamantine chain shirt.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 2nd level, as part of your study of magic you gain the ability to cast spells. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The Inventor table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your inventor spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>longstrider</i> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <i>longstrider</i> using either slot.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL OR HIGHER</h5>
            <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the inventor spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Inventor table shows when you learn more inventor spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the inventor spells you know and replace it with another spell from the inventor spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
            <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your inventor spells. The DM can optionally allow other things like artisan tools to count as your focus.</p>
        </description>
        <sheet>

        <description>
            <p>At 3rd level, choose an upgrade from the list at the end of your specialization, gaining the benefits listed in its description.</p>
            <p class="indent">You select an additional upgrade at 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th level. You can’t select an upgrade more than once, unless the upgrade’s description says otherwise. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can exchange one of your existing upgrades with another upgrade of the same level requirement as the replaced upgrade.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever an existing upgrade is exchanged for a replacement upgrade (either by a subclass feature or when you gain a level), the new upgrade is selected as if you’re the level you were when you originally gained that upgrade. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th-level inventor, you could select one 3rd-level upgrade and one 5th-level upgrade, or two 3rd-level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th-level upgrades.</p>
            <p>The following generic upgrades are available to all subclasses, and can be selected in place of any subclass upgrade</p>
            <p><em>Shield Proficiency</em> <i>Generic Unrestricted Upgrade</i> You gain proficiency with shields.</p>
            <p><em>Tool Proficiency</em> <i>Generic Unrestricted Upgrade</i> You gain proficiency with a tool of your choice.</p>
