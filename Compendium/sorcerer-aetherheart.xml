        <description>
            <p>Sorcerers of this origin are fueled by a deep connection to raw arcane energy, their soul touched by the raw stuff of the weave itself. Most of them don’t understand their connection to this power, but they can wield it with innate ease, manipulating magic by force of will alone.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sometimes this is artificial in nature—an ironwrought drawing power from their arcane heart, for example—while other times this marks an individual that was exposed to the raw essence of aether, becoming infused and intrinsically linked to it. They are characterized by an easy affinity of warping magic and ease of manipulating it in its raw and purest forms.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, you gain immunity to force damage. When you would take force damage, you regain health equal to half the damage you would have taken. You can gain a maximum amount of hit points this way equal to your sorcerer level, after which you no longer gain additional hit points until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
