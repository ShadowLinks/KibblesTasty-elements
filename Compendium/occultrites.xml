            <p>You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies. During a long rest, you can use them to concoct an improvised Potion of Healing by spending 1 hour of the long rest to tend to its simmering. Due to its improvised nature, it expires in 24 hours, and has no value in gold pieces.</p>
            <p class="indent">During this process, you can expend a 5th level spell to brew a Potion of Greater Healing instead. The expended spell slot is regained when the long rest is completed as normal.</p>

When you use this feature and as an action on your subsequent turns while it is animated you can make melee spell attack with a range of 10 feet, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage on hit.

The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast this way. Thereafter, a creature holding the item that is aware there is magic infused it can trigger the stored magic, with the effect of casting the spell.
            The spell uses your spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spell casting ability, but is all other ways treated as if the creature holding it cast the spell. You can infuse a number of spell levels equal to your proficiency bonus this, regaining the ability to infuse more when you complete a long rest.
