            <p>You gain proficiency with alchemistâ€™s supplies. During a long rest, you can use them to concoct an improvised Potion of Healing by spending 1 hour of the long rest to tend to its simmering. Due to its improvised nature, it expires in 24 hours, and has no value in gold pieces.</p>
            <p class="indent">During this process, you can expend a 5th level spell to brew a Potion of Greater Healing instead. The expended spell slot is regained when the long rest is completed as normal.</p>

            <p>You emblazon a mystical mark on yourself via a tattoo, scar, or similar permanent mark. You can use this mark as your spellcasting focus for your Occultist spells. You no longer need a free hand to cast spells with somatic or material components, as you can channel your magic through the mark, though it glows visibly when you do so. The mark must remain uncovered to function as a spellcasting focus (casting in this way does not remove the signs of casting a spell, it merely means you do not need a free hand).</p>
