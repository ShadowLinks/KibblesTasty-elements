            <p>You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies. During a long rest, you can use them to concoct an improvised Potion of Healing by spending 1 hour of the long rest to tend to its simmering. Due to its improvised nature, it expires in 24 hours, and has no value in gold pieces.</p>
            <p class="indent">During this process, you can expend a 5th level spell to brew a Potion of Greater Healing instead. The expended spell slot is regained when the long rest is completed as normal.</p>

When you do so, if either bonded creature makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, both creatures make the save. If either succeeds on the saving throw, both succeed, but if both fail, both are affected by the condition being saved against, even if only one was targeted. If both creatures are saving against the same effect, they do not roll twice, but both succeed if either succeeds on the saving throws and only fail if both fail the saving throw.</description>
