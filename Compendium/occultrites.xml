            <p>You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies. During a long rest, you can use them to concoct an improvised Potion of Healing by spending 1 hour of the long rest to tend to its simmering. Due to its improvised nature, it expires in 24 hours, and has no value in gold pieces.</p>
            <p class="indent">During this process, you can expend a 5th level spell to brew a Potion of Greater Healing instead. The expended spell slot is regained when the long rest is completed as normal.</p>

When you use this feature and as an action on your subsequent turns while it is animated you can make melee spell attack with a range of 10 feet, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage on hit.

            <description>When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals cold or necrotic damage, you can add {{wisdom:modifier}} to one damage roll of that spell. Channeling the power of death in this way temporarily withers and weakens you, reducing your movement speed by 5 feet until the end of your next turn.
            If you use this while already weakened in this way, the duration is extended and the effect is cumulative. A spell can only trigger one Revelation. If multiple Revelations apply, choose one.</description>

            <description>When you roll initiative or as a bonus action at any time, you can invoke the power of a mystery you know, causing its power to swirl around you forming a halo. This halo lasts until you invoke another Mystery this way, or dismiss it as a bonus action.
            Darkness. You shrouded in darkness and difficult to make out. You have half cover against attacks and are considered to be in dim light regardless of the surrounding light.
            Death. You gain resistance to necrotic damage. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 10 + the damage taken to be reduced to 1 hit point instead on success.
            Fire. You shed bright light in a 5 foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. You gain resistance to fire damage, and immunity to the fire damage of your own spells.
            Life. When you restore hit points to another creature, they gain temporary hit points equal to half the hit points restored.
            Light. You shed bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet (this light interacts with Truth of Light if you have that Rite). You gain resistance to radiant damage.
            Nature. You become surrounded by thorny vines. Any creature that strikes you with a melee weapon attack takes 1d8 piercing damage.
            Souls. You become ghostly and translucent, gaining a flying speed of 20 feet and can pass through objects less than a foot thick, as well as through creatures, and ignore all difficult terrain.
            War. When you take damage, you can subtract your Wisdom modifier from the damage taken (reducing it to a minimum of 1).</description>
