            <p>You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies. During a long rest, you can use them to concoct an improvised Potion of Healing by spending 1 hour of the long rest to tend to its simmering. Due to its improvised nature, it expires in 24 hours, and has no value in gold pieces.</p>
            <p class="indent">During this process, you can expend a 5th level spell to brew a Potion of Greater Healing instead. The expended spell slot is regained when the long rest is completed as normal.</p>

When you do so, if either bonded creature makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, both creatures make the save. If either succeeds on the saving throw, both succeed, but if both fail, both are affected by the condition being saved against, even if only one was targeted. If both creatures are saving against the same effect, they do not roll twice, but both succeed if either succeeds on the saving throws and only fail if both fail the saving throw.</description>

When you use this feature and as an action on your subsequent turns while it is animated you can make melee spell attack with a range of 10 feet, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage on hit. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th Level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). If you hit a Large or smaller creature with this attack, as a bonus action you can attempt to grapple the creature with your hair using your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier to initiate and maintain grapple. Your reach with touch spells is also increased to 10 feet while it is animated.</p>
            <p class="indent">A grappled creature can contest the grapple as normal, or deal 5 slashing, fire, or acid damage to the hair to free themselves. The hair has an AC of 12, and you take no damage when it is attacked.</p>
