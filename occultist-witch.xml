        <description>
            <p>A Witch can be many things, and most often refers to someone that villagers find scary and weird, but at the heart of every crazed story there's a sliver of truth, and that truth is that witches do indeed exist.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some may live openly as what they are, while others may be the last person the superstitious villagers might expect. Varied in their powers, designs, and traditions based on their Coven, generalizing about a Witch is challenging, but they are most often defined by the varied utilitarian magic, hexes that make crossing them unwise, and powerful intelligent familiars.</p>
