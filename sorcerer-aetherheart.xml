        <description>
            <p>While it is not uncommon for a construct forged to be powered by magic, some of them have such a potent source of magic imbued that they find themselves completely suffused with the overwhelming power, able to channel it to their own ends. When such a creature ends up sentient, it's inherently magical nature makes it a fundamentally magical creature, able to naturally wield it's magic as a Sorcerer.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this origin is most commonly found in constructed creatures - such as the Warforged - the world is a strange one and many paths can lead to such a fate. An alchemical attempt to raise the dead could leave the subject forever changed, implanted with a magical heart overflowing with power. A creature could even be born with such an abnormal condition, an elemental spark within them of ceaseless power.</p>
            <p class="indent">However it got there, in the chest of every Aether Heart Sorcerer is a pulsing source of neigh boundless energy that they struggle to control.</p>
