            <p>While many druids have a kinshape with the deep woods of nature, a Circle of the Woad Druid has a connection that can go much deeper, where some may wonder where the wyrd of the woad ends and the will of the druid starts. Legends say that the first of these druids were woads who took human form, rather than humans that took woad form, but such things are lost to legend.</p>
            <p class="indent">Frequently, regardless of the nature of their connection, these druids will feel most comfortable deep in nature, and place great value in its unspoiled form, sharing a world view more in common with dyrads and treants than other mortals... perhaps they were even raised by such creatures, leading them to this path.</p>
            <p class="indent">Members of this Circle stray toward what many would consider Neutral, not commonly becoming embroiled by mortal causes except where they overlap with their own concerns.</p>

            <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain an alternate use for Wild Shape. As a bonus action, you assume a treelike form, covered in leaves and bark, which lasts up to one hour, or until you end it as a bonus action or until you are incapacitated.</p>
            <p class="indent">You gain the following properties when you transform:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your size becomes Large. Your attacks gain the Reach property.</li>
                <li>You gain a natural weapon that is a club under the effect of shillelagh. While in this form, you can cast shillelagh on any weapon you are carrying.</li>
                <li>You can make a Wisdom (Athletics) check to initiate, maintain, or contest a grapple, and have a number of grappling appendages (in the form of grasping roots or branches) equal to your Wisdom modifier.</li>
                <li>Your AC is 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</li>
                <li>You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your Druid level when you transform into Woad form. When the form ends, you lose any temporary hit points you have from it.</li>
                <li>Any speed you have becomes 15 feet, unless the speed was lower.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment. Your equipment doesn't change to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</p>
