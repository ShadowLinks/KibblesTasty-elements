            <p>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery of the elements is an art form, causing them to act as if they were alive in your command, sculpting to your will. When you use a power or alternate effect of psychokinetics, you can infuse the power with your will and apply one of the following infusion modifiers to it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forming:</strong> The power forms into a melee weapon (like a blade). When you would make a ranged spell attack, making a melee spell attack instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlling:</strong> When you would target an arena, you can select a number of creatures equal to the psi points spent on the power or spell in that area for the elemental power to ignore, passing harmless around them. These creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</li>
                <li><strong>Reaching:</strong> The power stretches out reaching for its target. When you make a melee spell attack, you can give a reach of 15 feet. When you make a ranged spell attack, you double its range.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Alternatively you if you do not attempt to modify the power, the living powers rage more wildly and when you roll damage for the power or spell, you can reroll one damage die of the result per psi point spent. You must use the new roll.</p>
